\section{Prologue}

\subsection{}

The curator adjusted the head torch then began warming the short,
thin-bladed knife over the spirit burner which was placed diagonally
across the table from her. Satisfied that the sliver of steel was warm
enough to do its job yet not so hot as to cause melting, she carefully
worked it between the embossed disk of dark red wax and the paper
beneath it. The seal had also been applied on top of a silk cord from
which it took some careful working of the blade to remove but finally it
came away intact to be laid aside with a frisson of relief that no
damage had been done during its removal. Her mission was to reveal the
contents of the artifact with a view to re-assembling the parts into the
exact form in which the whole had been created over a century earlier.
This was no easy task since the packet, which was about the size of
modern paperback, had been thoroughly secured so as to evidence even the
slightest attempt at tampering.

A second seal was slowly and painstakingly removed, allowing the length
of silk cord which had parcelled up the packet to be gently eased off.
The cord, still dutifully trying to hold its shape, was placed to the
left of the table. Soon all of the five seals that had been applied to
the the enveloping sheet of paper were removed and set down beside the
cord. The time had come to open the outer wrapper and take the first
glimpse of what lay beneath.

The packet had spent the day in a sealed box with the vapours of a seven
parts alcohol to one part water mixture. This should have worked on the
white glue, which owed its adhesive properties to the protein colloid
processed from the bones of animals and fish, degrading it so as to
allow the top triangle of fine wove paper to be lifted easily. It was
not to be, however, and the edges of the flap needed delicate dabbing
with a small sponge held by tweezers and dampened with some of the
alcohol and water mix that had been warmed a little. Perhaps impatience
got the better of the curator as she took up the slender knife once more
for her first attempt at working the knife beneath the flap because the
blade snagged, almost tearing the paper.

The select group of museum friends who had been invited to attend this
special event and who had been unconsciously leaning ever further
forward as the curator did her work now drew in their breath as one.
Each now became suddenly self-conscious, their rapt attention broken,
and they began exchanging meaningful looks. For all that they tried to
keean aura of a discrete distance and a reverend hush, their presence
had now intruded and broken the curator's concentration. She leant back
in her chair, removed the irksome head torch and massaged her forehead.
Accustomed to the intense torchlight, the candlelit room now seemed dim.
Perhaps this was just as well as it helped to maintain a professional
distance from the audience.

The meticulous preparations for tonight's event had begun some hours
earlier. A blanket was spread over the polished wood of the dinning room
table then covered with a clean, white, cotton cloth. A single,
leather-covered, straight-backed chair was placed behind the table with
its back to the huge dining room window. Everything that could
conceivably be needed was arranged on the cloth so as to all be within
easy reach from the chair. Next, the ornate double doors into the grand
salon were slid open so that the two dozen or so invited guests could be
accommodated between the two rooms without having to crowd round the
table.

It was now midsummer dark outside but inside a romantic tallow glow
belied the long process of lighting all the candles of the many
candelabra in the hall, reception room, grand salon and dining room. The
heavy, blue velvet curtains at the windows facing onto the road which
passes between the front of the house and the park beyond were drawn.
The huge shutters at windows to the rear of the house were closed,
excluding their view of the old, formal garden with its ancient copper
beech and the waters of the Hollandse IJssel beyond. Finally, the
curator had gone to the vapour box and carefully removed the treasured
packet, borne it through the house and laid on the table with great
reverence.

Late on the previous day a sober-suited lawyer had brought the packet
from the safe at the museum's trustees premises in Rotterdam. The
trustees had been most reluctant to agree to the packet's removal from
their purview but the curator had stood her ground until they relented.
The museum was the house where the artifact had been produced and was
where it's contents should be revealed. It had come home, so to speak,
to be properly cared for rather than pawed at by soulless money-men. The
trustees had not capitulated totally, imposing the condition that their
lawyer remain present throughout proceedings, even keeping an
uninterrupted vigil beside the vapour box.

The curator gathered her wandering thoughts, replaced the head torch and
returned her attention to the packet The guests quietened down at the
resumption of activity as at the package. This time the curator made
greater allowance being for the liquid being applied to soak into the
old-fashioned glue. Timing was of the essence as letting the fine wove
paper become wet to the point of soggy would also court disaster. But,
at last, the flap permitted itself to be prised open.

Now the moment had arrived for the packet to be opened and the cache of
documents that it had concealed since 1922 released into the light. It
would have brought a touch of magic to the proceedings had it been
possible to withdraw the papers one by one with a flourish as a conjurer
might pull playing cards from a top hat. However, the thoroughness of
their author's preparation thwarted this performance with an encircling
girdle of fine, pink, silk ribbon intended to maintain the neatness of
her precious bundle. This occasioned a further delay as time was needed
for the careful removal of the intact bundle from its outer clothing,
followed by the teasing apart of another knot and the laying aside of
paper and ribbon.

One hundred years of close confinement had trained the documents to stay
in their allotted places despite the removal their restraints. The
curator could not resist giving in to the impulse to theatricality as
she made a play of clothing her hands in a pair of fine, white cotton
gloves, slowly smoothing each finger into its sheath. Only when the
protective gloves were situated to her complete satisfaction was the top
paper separated from the rest of the pile in preparation for reading its
contents out to the assembled audience. She faltered now, being a child
of the age of digital type the curator was unaccustomed to reading this
sort of handwritten material. It added to the challenge that the text
was in the shaky hand of an octogenarian given to idiosyncratic
abbreviations and using an antiquated form of the Dutch language. So, it
was a halting but contemporary rendition of the letter which was read
out loud for the benefit of those present:

\begin{quote}
To the people of Haastrecht, My last will and testament, which was
signed and witnessed this day, bequeaths my house and sufficient of my
estates to support its upkeep in trust for you, the people of
Haastrecht, on condition that nothing in the house is changed. When you
read this letter then one hundred years will have passed since my death
and the execution of my will must have secured the physical legacy of
the Bisdom van Vliet family. So, I will now address another aspect of
the Bisdom van Vliet legacy that I am anxious should be preserved.

It is said that a person is not truly lost to the living whilst they are
still remembered and spoken of. I believe this to be true. Since I am
the last Bisdom van Vliet it falls to me to pass on the human legacy of
my family through means other than the blood line, by which I mean my
biography as seen through the clear lens of time. The notes, letters and
diary pages enclosed in this packet have been carefully selected by me
in order to reveal something of the true characters and private lives of
the individuals involved. By waiting for a century to pass I can be sure
that none of those mentioned will neither feel any hurt nor be tempted
to arrogance by what is contained herein. It is my wish that someone
will take up their pen to reveal my story.

I have witnessed many changes during my long life and wish to
acknowledge that, a century after my passing, much will again be altered
from the world I know. The last document in this packet is a codicil to
my original will, which I am assured will be legally binding. In it I
have made provision for a response to these changes.

--- Weduwe Bisdom van Vliet, 21e december 1922
\end{quote}

Anxious to discover what was meant by this unexpected final word from
the writer, the curator tried to separate the bottom paper from those
above it but, frustratingly, it refused to budge. So, slowly and
painstakingly, beginning at the top of the pile, the documents were
separated one by one then laid out in strict order across the table so
that the gathering might at least look upon them. The final two
documents proved to be stuck together by the seal affixed to the bottom
one. The assembled pile must have been placed on top of the will codicil
before the wax of its seal had completely set. Once more, the warmed
knife was patiently applied to achieve the separation of the two
documents. Then, just as the knife was about to be applied to the
removal of the seal from the will codicil there was a distraction in the
form of a bustle of motion and a stage cough nearby. Looking up, the
curator came face to stony face with the Bisdom van Vliet trust's
lawyer.

``I think that we should observe the same legal procedure as is usual
for the reading of a will. It is my view, also, that the appropriate
experts in the relevant speciality of the law should be consulted in
order to make a determination as to whether this additional document is,
indeed, valid and binding. We need to be sure of our position before we
announce Weduwe Bisdom van Vliet's final wish to the public.''

The curator knew that the lawyer was right despite her frustration at
the anti-climax of having so nearly exposed this last, unanticipated
mystery. With reluctance, the sealed document was yielded up to the
lawyer's outstretched, ungloved hand with a request that the he set
about making the necessary arrangements as soon as possible. For the
time being, all that remained was to supervise the museum's guests as
they filed past the table to view the materials laid out upon it and
made their way out of the building.

After what seemed like an eternity, the curator was alone in the house.
A decade had passed since her appointment as curator of the museum
during which time she felt that a relationship had developed between
Paulina, as she called the widow, and herself. The curator lived in a
small but modern flat in what had previously been part of the house used
only by servants. Her working days were spent in the dusty splendour of
the main part of the house which had, indeed, been left in a century
long time warp. She had also got into the habit of wandering the rooms
when the museum was closed, sometimes coming to rest in a chair and
exercising her imagination in order to empathise with Paulina. It would
only be right that she should be the one to write the widow's biography
since she felt such a strong connection with her already. This surely
gave her the right to be the first to see what was contained in the
documents Paulina had provided as a window onto her life. Resuming her
seat at the dinning table, the curator replaced her white, cotton gloves
and gently picked up the first piece of paper ...

\section{Juni 1869}

\subsection{}

The door before her opened and Pauline stepped out of the shadow of the
house into the warm, summer sunshine.

The early days of June had been exceptionally cold with flurries of snow
by day and ice-cold nights as winter had reached through spring to try
its grip on another season. But now the persistent sun swept winter into
oblivion to give Gouda a glorious Sunday morning. Like many other
families from the houses lining the sides of the haven, they had decided
to take advantage of the uplifting weather and walk the short distance
to Sint Janskerk for morning worship. The trees which shaded the quays
were in their best green for the day. Children from the schuitje moored
alongside ran in and out of the tree trunks, klompen rattling rhythms on
the cobbles. Pauline's nieces and nephews longed to join these other
children in their games but the two governesses kept them all under
tight control lest they become distracted and lag behind.

This family party heading for church was not quite complete. Little
Cornelis Catharinus was only eighteen months old so had remained in his
nursery. His mother, Aegidia, who was due to deliver her eighth child in
just a few weeks, had also stayed at home, feeling herself to be too
large in her pregnancy to venture out and about. She remained indoors
trying to rest on her \emph{chaise longue} but actually feeling too
uncomfortable to settle properly. So it was that Pauline, her
half-sister - the maiden aunt - walked beside the head of the household
and accepted the greetings of other church-goers in Aegidia's place.

Pauline had been an impressionable fifteen year old when Aegidia married
childhood sweatheart, Theodorus Pieter Viruly. Having recently been
given Aernout Drost's \emph{Hermingard of the Oaken Mounds} to read she
was awash with the idea of romance between men and women, especially if
the men were heroic. Hearing her parents talk about Theo's courageous
business decisions and staunch political stands, it had seemed to her
that he was made of the very stuff of heroism. Then there was all the
excitement of Aggie's wedding preparations, the house being filled with
swatches of fabric, dress designs, recipes and table dressing
catalogues. The look of adoration in Aggie's eyes when she ran to Theo
upon his arrival at the house and the aura of mystery and delight that
came over everyone when the honeymoon was alluded to served to intensify
the the attraction which the febrile girl-woman felt for her soon-to-be
brother-in-law.

Although Theo was now almost fifty years of age, Pauline still
experienced some of the same excitement that she had felt for her
romantic hero of all those years ago. Although somewhat changed in
nature, she found that his allure had in some way grown over the years
as he had risen to become both wealthy and powerful. Under his
management the family laundry business had transformed itself into a
highly lucrative soap and candle works in newly built premises. On the
domestic front, he had taken an old canal-side merchant's dwelling and
had it re-built as the grand house known simply as 'De Haven'. He had
filled his new house with a suitable wife and their burgeoning family of
healthy children whilst finding the time to rise in the world of
politics.

As the family group made their way along Oosthaven quayside, they were
encouraged towards the church by the tolling of its four great bells.
From time to time they were obliged to step aside for those worshippers
who had ordered out their carriages, the east side of the haven being on
the direct route to the great church. Each time Pauline took to the
narrow footpath in the shadow of the houses, Theo unwittingly brushed
against her arm and she began to feel a flush of excitement in
anticipation of his next touch. She tried to feel ashamed of herself but
the light was too bewitching, the sun too warming and the sound of the
church bells too enchanting for her to be able to punish herself for
taking an extra morsel of pleasure at this physical contact.

Reaching Dubbele Buurt they had the best view of the Sint Janstoren as
it rose high into the blue sky, being visible from as far away as
Waddinxveen. Accident and design had resulted in a layered confection
with a square base of three distinct stone storeys: the original
fourteenth century construction being succesively topped by additions in
1590 and 1605. In the mid-seventeenth century, a hexagonal lantern had
grown up from the stone stump with an openwork section housing a 36-bell
carillon. Finally, a narrow waist flared again into a small onion-dome
from which the weather-veined lightening rod seems reach all the way to
God in his heaven.

Pauline had the sensation of gently falling backwards as a her gaze
followed the Sint Janstoren spire right to its tip. She almost reached
out to Theo to steady herself but that head-swimming moment soon passed
as her gaze responded to the more earthly need to watch where she was
treading on the uneven and dung strewn road.

As they reached the narrowness and bustle of Achter de Kerk a tall man
in naval uniform stood aside to allow the family party to keep together
as they went inside to take their places among the congregation. Pauline
noticed that Theo nodded to him in thanks and, perhaps, recognition but
no words were exchanged. Then she was caught up in the business of
settling the family into their pews, taking her place near the end of
the row so that she might be of some help to the governesses in managing
the children, each woman now having charge of two young ones.

As it turned out, Pauline was settled between the two eldest children:
Catharina Johanna, aged eleven-and-a-half, and Maria Elisabeth,
soon-to-be ten. Both girls were generally well-behaved in church, having
reached such a stage in their understanding of the world as to
appreciate the need for mannered behaviour during holy worship. Both
also enjoyed the chance to show off their fine voices, the fruits of the
labours of their singing master. Usually their already refined talents
and well-developed lady-like qualities made Pauline feel quite the dull,
country aunt, but she was not herself that day and seemed to rise above
such self-consciousness.

She had been to services in Sint Janskerk many times before and admired
its beauty, as it were, from a mental distance. Today the feeling of
standing back from the scene had left her and she became totally
absorbed in the magical transformation wrought by the sunlight pouring
into the vast space of the interior with its high wooden vaults and its
white walls pierced by lofty glass windows. The great swags of gilded
organ pipes seemed to shimmer with reflected light. Of all the wonderful
windows it was the one depicting The Sacrifice of the Prophet Elijah
that drew Pauline's attention that day. To be precise, she became
totally absorbed in the image of Margaretha van Parma at the bottom of
the window.

In the sixteenth century Margaretha had been Landvoogdes van de
Nederlanden and, as Governess of the Low Countries, had paid for this
window to be made as a vanity piece. Pauline must have heard the story
of Margaretha's life from one of her tutors but had relegated the
details to the back of her mind. On this sunny, summer, Sunday morning
this image of a powerful and worldly woman from three centuries ago
became an almost tangible presence. From beneath the Governess's crown
of gold a youthful woman's face looked out, exuding strength and
confidence which flowed like warm wine through Pauline's arteries as she
met the eyes in the glass portrait.

Fashionably and opulently dressed in gold cloth, lace and furs,
Margaretha still managed to be both pious and upright. By contrast,
Pauline had never been very interested in her appearance, rising above
the pain of knowing that the people of Haastrecht called her 'the farmer
girl' behind her back. She had felt that no alchemy of fashion could
transform her sturdy frame, plain looks and unruly hair into such a
beautiful creature as Aggie and her friends. The sheer amount of effort
it would take to make beauty from such unpromising material had always
seemed to Pauline to be a travesty of nature and of what God had given
her. Now, though, Margaretha van Parma was giving her permission to make
the most of herself free from the burden of aiming for the impossible
and without the worry that she was sinfully vain.

The more she looked into Margaretha's luminous eyes the more she grasped
a deeper message from this woman. Yes, Pauline could fulfil her destiny
as a wealthy and powerful woman without sacrificing the feminine desire
for marriage and children. Like Margaretha, she would be strong, proud
and have a masculine consciousness of her place in this world yet make a
marriage that would produce heirs and stand the test of time. But, and a
chill note of caution came now, this could only happen if each party
contracted to a marriage that left them free to follow their individual
paths. Margaretha had made an undignified and unhappy marriage at
sixteen to a boy two years her junior, to whom she bore twins, but this
liaison had metamorphosed over the years into a lasting mutual respect
for what each was achieving in their lives. Pauline now knew in her
heart and soul that she would henceforth be her true self, which was so
much more than the dutiful and dull woman of just moments ago.

So taken up with these revelations was she that Pauline lost awareness
of her surroundings until the great organ let out a rich, swelling cord
startling her back into the present moment with its signal that the
service was about to start. Her whole being resonated with this
crescendo in celebration of new beginning and she woke to the moment,
rising to her feet with the rest of the congregation to devote herself
heart and soul to the first hymn.

\subsection{}

The service over, the children set off for home with an enthusiasm which
the governesses could not quite curb. Pauline had expected to stay by
Theo's side on the return to 'De Haven' but a number of men were clearly
intent on engaging him in conversation as he left the church. No doubt
they were taking the opportunity to press their interests with the man
who was not only their councillor and alderman but was also a senator in
the Eerste Kamer of parliament in Den Haag. She waited for the bulk of
the congregation to depart before wandering back towards Oosthaven by
herself, yet not feeling alone. As she regained the quays she saw that
the schuitje that had been moored alongside earlier was now being worked
through the gates of the Donkere Sluis. Along with several other
churchgoers, she stopped to watch as the little boat negotiated this
awkward navigation, enjoying the unhurried nature of the activity and
the feel of the day.

From across the lock, a group of children began singing with great gusto
the old rhyme to encourage the rowers of the 'little cooking pot' boat:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
Schuitje varen, theetje drinken,
Varen we naar de Overtoom.
Drinken er zoete melk met room.
Zoete melk met brokken,
Kindje mag niet jokken.
            
Sail your boat, drink your tea,
We're sailing to the Overtoom*.
Drinking sweet milk with cream.
Sweet milk with bread lumps,
children, don't tell fibs.
*The Overtoom was a canal in the suburbs of Amsterdam that connected important waterways.
          
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Looking over at the impromptu choir, she was surprised to find her eyes
meeting those of the naval officer whom the family had briefly
encountered on the way into church. They exchanged smiles which
encouraged the officer to make his way over the set of lock gates on the
IJssel side as soon as they closed and she soon found him standing
before her, extending his hand in introduction,

``Lieutenant le Fèvre de Montigny at your service.''

He bowed low over her hand before releasing it but continuing to look
directly into her eyes. His own eyes were a liquid brown and she began
to feel herself falling as if into a deep pool. He was tall, slim and
very attractive. He had combed his thick, black hair back from his
forehead and applied just enough Macassar oil so that it shone in the
sunlight. His facial whiskers were also dark and dense, spreading down
his jaw and across his top lip, yet his chin and neck were shaved bare
as was the fashion in Den Haag.

``I think you are a relative of Mr Viruly. You have his stature.''

She was amazed that he, the first person whom she had encountered since
Margaretha had awakened her, could appreciate that she was a significant
woman.

``I am Paulina Bisdom van Vliet, his wife's half-sister.''

All her life she had insisted on being known as ``Pauline'' so that she
would be distinguished from her grandmother, Paulina Maria
Hondorff-Block, after whom she had been named. It came as a surprise to
her to find that she had suddenly and without thought reclaimed her
proper name, her own name.

``Your father is the burgemeester of Haastrecht?''

She nodded assent.

``Then I have had the honour of making his acquaintance at my brother's
house. Gilles was the burgemeester of Berkel and Rodenrijs and has just
become burgemeester of Hillegerberg and Bergschenhoek. Both your father
and Viruly were his supporters in gaining his improved appointment.''

She was glad to hear that he moved in the same social circles as her
family and was not going to prove an embarrassment to be seen talking
to. She also liked that he was tall. Looking up to him made her feel
feminine since she was herself taller than most men. Anxious now that
their conversation should not flag, she enquired,

``Are you in Gouda with your ship?''

``I am between voyages at present and like to stay at the Hotel De Zalm
here. So, it is fortuitous that we have met today. I see that you are
watching the operation of the lock, do you have an interest in
navigation?''

``Since I was a child I watched boats pass our house on the Hollandse
IJssel and bring cargo along the Vlist to the Haven in Haastrecht, but I
know nothing of the sea or of the marine.''

He easily took up her conversational opening and began to tell of his
sea voyages, allowing Paulina to ask questions and show interest at
appropriate points so that she did not feel excluded. They had just
arrived at Curaçao in the West Indies, where Lieutenant le Fèvre de
Montigny's ship was visited by Governor Landsbergen, when she noticed
that Theo had detached himself from his followers and was approaching.
Since the two men were acquainted, she expected Theo to join them but
instead he slowed to a stop a pace or two away, clearly waiting for her
to join him. She was somewhat reluctant to part from the handsome
lieutenant but also understood that one did not keep Theodorus Pieter
Viruly waiting. The lieutenant noticed the social dilemma she faced and
quickly resolved it for her by turning and taking a step towards Theo,
thus allowing her to do the same. The lieutenant then greeted Theo
enthusiastically,

``Good morning, Mayor Viruly! Let me give you my hand!''

Theo only briefly touched the hand extended to him and grunted a
greeting in reply before offering Paulina his arm and steering her in
the direction of Oosthaven. So swift was her disengagement from the
lieutenant that she felt her farewell was cut so short as to be almost
rude. Minded to say something to Theo as she was rather cross with him
not only for leaving her alone after church but also for tearing her
away from her handsome new friend, she chided him,

``Lieutenant le Fèvre de Montigny was good enough to escort me after
church since your politics detained you for so long. I found his company
most engaging and understood that you and he were acquainted. I am sorry
to be parted from him so briskly and hope that I shall meet him again.''

Theo was silent for some time before replying,

``Yes, I have met le Fèvre de Montigny and so has your father. His
brother is in politics and looks to do well. I am sorry if you thought
me rather unfriendly just now.''

There the matter rested and they were soon back inside De Haven and into
the thick of family life once more.

\subsection{}

Sunday dinner was a family meal and rather chaotic so it was well into
the afternoon before Aegidia and Paulina were alone. Paulina went to sit
with Aggie as she tried to rest since she said that she often got bored
by being so inactive and left all by herself. It was not long before
Aggie remarked upon the change in Paulina's demeanour, saying that she
seemed somehow stronger in herself yet almost girlishly excited at the
same time.

Aggie knew her half-sister well having moved to the burgemeester's house
following his marriage to her mother. Aggie had been seven when Paulina
was born and the age gap between them had not always been comfortable.
They became closer after Aggie's older brother and sister both died in
the same year, throwing the two daughters into each other's company when
the one was just past childhood at eleven and the other, at eighteen,
was almost a woman. Their relationship came into full bloom after Aggie
married and the children started to come along. She had felt able to
confide things in Paulina which she did not care to share with their
mother. In return, Paulina had confided her horror at the string of
unappealing young men who had been put before her as potential husbands.
They had laughed together at their coarse features, or their foppish
dress, or their arrogant manners, or their blatant desire to advance
themselves through marriage. Aggie had also wiped away the tears when
the ones that Paulina did like had disappeared, never to return to her
side.

Now, once she heard that Paulina had been talking to a handsome young
naval lieutenant that morning, Aggie pressed her for all the details of
the encounter. As Paulina started talking about him she self-consciously
realised that she sounded just like a girl in love. Aggie picked up on
this immediately, asking,

``Tell me, sister, did you perhaps flirt with him a little?''

Paulina found herself blushing and left with no choice but to confess
that perhaps she had -- just a little.

``I am so pleased for you that you have found someone who takes your
fancy! Now, let us consider how suitable a match he would be for you.
What do you know of his family?''

``Well, his brother is a burgemeester and both papa and Theo know him.
He is an officer in the marine, too, and looks so handsome in his
uniform! He has such interesting things to say about his voyages and the
places he has visited. I wonder if he has ever been in a battle? He
didn't say.''

``I think that you are getting a little distracted! If he were in the
military then I would know exactly who his family is. There were
illustrious military engineers called le Fèvre de Montigny, so he may be
connected with them. In which case, he is of the patriciate and socially
on a par with us. We should ask Theo or papa to find out more.''

``Oh, but isn't that making rather a lot of fuss after just one, brief
meeting?''

``My dear! I have never seen you show such an interest in a man and I am
so excited for you that I want to help all I can. He just might be the
right one for you and we shouldn't let him get away! It is not as though
you are a mere girl and this just an infatuation that will be gone by
tomorrow! You will be twenty nine years old in a few days and have a
mature woman's sensibilities and not a little experience in dealing with
potential suitors. I think that we need to find out more about your
handsome stranger.''

``But what if he is married or I don't feel the same next time I see
him?''

``We must be patient and leave it to the men to find out more. But, in
the meantime, perhaps we can make sure that you chance upon a second
meeting? You said that he is resident at Hotel De Zalm? Well then, it
should be easy! If you find reason to stroll in the Markt for long
enough you are sure to encounter him. You might even take coffee at the
hotel during the cheese market. How I wish that my condition allowed me
to go with you! As it is, my great belly would be enough to put off any
man!''

``Poor Aggie, is it really so bad?''

``I must confess that I am finding it exhausting this time. The doctor
says that this must be my last pregnancy if I am to fully recover my
health after the birth. But I seem to become pregnant so easily that I
am not sure how I shall stop! I could go on to have another five or ten
children before I am too old to conceive! What a dreadful thought!''

``Our mama must have been about the same age as you when I was born yet
there were no more children after me. Poor papa, he so wanted a son to
inherit his position and wealth but all he got was me! Which brings me
to the other thing that happened to me today: I have become resolved to
do all that I can do in this life and not be hindered by the limitations
on what is expected of me because of my sex. I was looking at Margaretha
van Parma in the stained glass window I was sitting under in church this
morning and she seemed pour her strength into me. So, if le Fèvre de
Montigny is to be my husband, he had better know that I shall not bend
myself or my destiny to accommodate his - or anyone else's - notion of
wifely behaviour!''

``Good gracious, Pauline. You are quite disconcerting me!''

``Well, you might as well know straight away that I now call myself
Paulina, with the 'a' that I was Christened with. I assure you that
nobody will ever confuse me with old Oma now!''

``I am quite sure that you are right in that! Now, Paulin-with-an-A, I
have had quite enough excitement for one day so, please will you read to
me for a while? Since I must spend so much of my day in idleness I
thought I should exercise my mind in compensation. Whilst you were at
church I began reading 'Max Havelaar' to see what all the fuss was about
when it was published some years ago. I have to confess that Mr Douwes
Dekker's style is most conducive to rest as it fails to excite. Yet, I
feel that I must continue with it as the subject matter is important.
Theo is concerned with the political debates about our East Indies
colonies so it will be good to inform myself about the topic so that I
might appear more knowledgeable and interested when he talks of his work
in Den Haag.''

``Is that the Multatuli book?''

``Yes.''

``What a strange \emph{nom de plume}.''

``Apparently it is Latin for 'I have borne much' -- which seems
appropriate for my situation! I fear that the poor man had a bad time of
things in Java. It seems such a far-away place and such a different
place to Holland that I find it hard to believe that his tales have much
to do with us ordinary Dutch people. It has caused quite a stir, though.
Maybe you will be able to put some excitement into it when you read a
passage for me?''

Paulina did try to make the tale interesting but Aggie was soon fast
asleep and she did not chose to carry on with the book for herself.
Unwilling to risk waking Aggie by leaving the room in order to fetch her
writing materials, she reached for the novel by Ouida which Aggie had
just finished reading and commended to her. Fortunately this was in
translation from the original English, a language in which Aggie was
competent but that was opaque to Paulina. So, to find \emph{Idalia} in
Dutch had been something of a treat, especially since the story was
compelling enough to distract her from her passion for keeping her
journal.

Immediately captivated by the courageous, clever, independent and
muscular Queen's Messenger with the exotic, Scottish name of Sir Fulke
Erceldoune, Paulina had been gathered up and swept along with his
headlong fall for the beautiful Countess Idalia Vassalis, who had saved
his life, Hoping for a romantic, happy ending, it had been distressing
to discover that Idalia was actually an enchantress who bewitched men
then bent them to her political will before discarding them or, worse,
sending them to their deaths. But all was not lost and Paulina became
heartened again by the prospect of Idalia's love for Fulke being the
saving grace which would reform her, showing her to be a virtuous soul
worthy of the hero's devotion after all. The novel was proving to be a
much more riveting way of exercising the moral faculties than her usual
diet of the sermons and poetry of Utrecht minister Nicolaas Beets, whose
latest tome remained buried in her luggage.

\subsection{}

Despite Aggie's urging her to frequent the environs of Hotel De Zalm in
the hope of another encounter with the handsome naval officer, several
days elapsed before Paulina again set foot outside 'De Haven'. She was
to accompany Theo once more but this time they were not headed for
church but for the new railway station. It was another glorious summer
day as they left the house and were handed into the Viruly's smart, new
Victoria carriage with it's liveried driver. Paulina had a keen eye for
horse flesh and was appreciative of the fine pair of bay mares which
were harnessed and waiting patiently, their coats gleaming in the
sunlight.

The carriage hood was down so that they were open to the sights, sounds
and feel of day. They had no sooner set off along Oosthaven heading for
the Markt when the Sint Janskerk carillon began chiming out the Meideun
tune to signal the hour for ten o'clock. Paulina let herself relax back
into her seat so as to fully enjoy the music, the sun's warmth and the
sights as they made their progress past the stepped gables and slender
spires of the stadhuis in the centre of the market square before taking
the Hoogstradt, crossing the Turfsingel and Kattensingel canal bridges
to reach Stationsplein.

It had to be admitted that there was rather more excitement for their
outing today than there had been last Sunday for this was a day of
celebration for Theo. The people of Gouda had not taken easily to the
notion of rail transport when their business had done so well out of the
shipping that passed through Holland's busiest river junction. It had
been unfortunate that the first train line was laid to the north of the
city centre, being unable to breach the walls and canals so as to arrive
at a more convenient location. Indeed, the townsmen had refused to
contribute to the building of a proper station leaving train travellers
to make do with a rather basic wooden construction beside the single
track which linked Rotterdam and Utrecht.

Characteristically undaunted, Theo had worked hard on behalf of the
Nederlandsche Rhijnspoorweg-Maatschappij, of which he was a shareholder
and board member, and today his efforts would come to fruition. He had
exercised his political skills to have the town boundary re-drawn so
that the station now lay within Gouda's compass. His business acumen was
instrumental in the development of a second track which, passing through
Harmelen and Breukelen, would soon enable travel between Rotterdam and
Amsterdam. A third line to Den Haag would follow making it possible to
travel easily between Holland's three great maritime cities: Rotterdam,
Amsterdam and Den Haag. Competition from the Hollandsche IJzeren
Spoorweg-Maatschappij's direct line between Rotterdam and Amsterdam via
Den Haag had been successfully beaten off, largely because Theo had
advocated investment in modern engineering techniques to deal with the
problems of laying track across waterlogged land.

The Rhijnspoorweg line continued beyond Gouda to Utrecht and Arnhem then
went on to Oberhausen across the border, thus opening up not only the
whole of the central and eastern Netherlands but also Germany. Theo had
grasped the possibility that at least some of the anticipated numbers of
people on board all these trains might be encouraged to break their
journey in Gouda and contribute to the town's trade. To this end he had
persuasively argued that a station which made the right impression on
the travel hardened and weary was crucial to local enterprise. Today was
to see the first stage Theo's grand vision for his home town realised
when passengers from Rotterdam and Utrecht would be able to alight at
Gouda's distinctive new station building which offered all the
facilities a traveller might require. A group of specially invited
guests were to arrive on the next train from Rotterdam and join with the
local dignitaries for a formal opening ceremony followed by inaugural
festivities in the station's restaurant.

Having arrived at the station in good time for the train from Rotterdam,
Theo left Paulina to stroll around the building and platform whilst he
went to check that all was in order. He had wanted to be early so that
he could round up the chosen members of the welcoming party and ensure
that everyone was in the right place at the right time, and doing the
right thing. Anxious that Gouda and its station should gain the approval
of the august company soon to arrive, he had worked hard to ensure that
the building was ready, the staff well-trained and provided with new
uniforms, and the restaurant able to lay on a sumptous mid-day meal.

Paulina had caught some of his mood and paced restlessly and aimlessly
around. First she wandered through the ticket hall with its window
already manned in preparation for the first customers and the porters
with their trolleys waiting to assist with luggage. Then she
investigated the waiting rooms, declining the attentions of the maid who
was eager to seat her in the women's room. Paulina was unable to sit or
stand still, however, and soon passed out onto the platform. Everywhere
was lavishly decked in bunting or garlanded with fresh flowers whose
scent barely masked the lingering odour of fresh paint. Paulina found
herself gazing hopefully in the direction from which the Rotterdam train
would arrive, although she knew it was not yet due for some time.

The excitement of the occasion was especially heightened for Paulina as
her beloved papa was one of the honoured guests due to arrive by train
as he returned from a week attending to his shipping business in
Rotterdam. It had been decided that, following the station opening, she
and papa would continue on home to Haastrecht together in the comfort of
Theo's new carriage. On its return journey to Gouda the carriage would
bring mama, Paulina and Aggie's mother, who wanted to be on hand in
plenty of time for the arrival of the new baby. Paulina was looking
forward to swapping news with her father, the urgency for which seemed
to be further fuelled by their at daily exchange of letters. She had
also begun to hanker for home and, if truth were told, was keen to
exercise her spirit and mind in the management of the family house and
estates. As was usual for daughters of the patriciate, her education had
all been in preparationfor the conduct her own affairs upon her
marriage. So far, she had been afforded little opportunity to test
herself in this respect, having been cast as assistant to her mother.
Paulina had always deferred to her mama's way of doing things but now
her new-found confidence and strength of will made her determined to
take charge and be autonomous. She found the prospect of being in
control during mama's absence quite exhilarating.

The tasks ahead of her were busily running through her head as Paulina
turned to retrace her steps to the entrance hall. Suddenly he was there!
Not in his uniform this time, but her heart recognised him before she
was fully conscious of it and let out an involuntary cry then hastily
put her hands to her face as if to push the noise back inside of her. At
the muffled sound he turned from supervising the porter who was stacking
his luggage and quickly covered the distance between them.

``Is there something the matter?''

He asked and before she had time to think about what she would say
Paulina had replied,

``Oh, no, not at all! I had so hoped to see you again but now it seems
that you are going away, perhaps on a long sea voyage!''

She was aware that this was a rather bold and forthright utterance,
although it was truthful. But Johan Jacob le Fèvre de Montigny was not a
man to be thrown by forwardness in a woman, finding the whole
\emph{etiquette} of courtship rather tedious. He happily replied in kind
whilst hoping to be able to put a name to her vaguely recalled face.

``Do not concern yourself, my dear, I am merely paying a visit to my
brother in Hillegersberg. I shall not be far away and, in any case, will
return to De Zalm in a week or so's time. Are you taking the train
yourself?''

``No, I am here in my step-sister's place beside Theo Viruly at the
opening ceremony; and to meet my father who is arriving with the
official party from Rotterdam. We are to go home to Haastrecht later
today but I am sure that I shall be back in Gouda once my latest niece
or nephew arrives.''

At last, Johan placed the woman. She was the only daughter of the
burgemeester of Haastrecht and she seemed to be setting her cap at him.
He was intrigued!

``My brother is among the burgemeesters from Rotterdam who have been
invited today. Perhaps you would like to be introduced to him?''

``Oh, yes, that would be delightful! You can meet my father, too! This
has really turned out to be a most fortunate encounter!''

Johan had a vague sense that he was not quite in control of the way
things were going as the young woman seemed to be slightly more
enthusiastic than his polite offer of an introduction warranted. Since
he couldn't quite put his finger on what, if anything, was wrong with
it, he went along with her enthusiasm and nodded his agreement.

A sudden commotion of people arriving on the platform from inside the
station building put paid to any further dialogue. Theo was marshalling
the reception committee into place whilst the station master took up a
position at the platform's edge, extracting his shiny new timepiece from
the pocket of his smart uniform coat and consulting it. It would not do
for his first train to be late! A distant whistle reassured him that all
was well as Theo stepped up beside him in readiness to greet the
distinguished city men.

The driver skilfully halted his train so that the door of the first
class carriage containing his most notable passengers came to rest
exactly beside the two waiting men. The carriage door was opened with
some ceremony by the station master and the men inside began to alight.
Theo shook the hand of each before they passed on to mingle with the
local mayors and patriarchs behind him. Paulina was only looking for one
face, that of her father, Marcellus. As soon as she saw him she was
hardly able to stop herself from running to him. He had seen her, too,
and extricated himself from the round of greetings as soon as was polite
so that they were soon embracing affectionately.

Meanwhile, Johan had located his brother and worked his way into the
crowd to place himself at Gillis's right elbow. The brothers did not
exchange greetings and seemed not to acknowledge each other, yet they
moved through the cluster of guests as one. Johan lost no time in
shaking hands and swapping names with many prominent men who assumed
that he, too, was important. He was charming and personable, seeming to
be in the acquaintance of the burgemeester of the rapidly developing
Hellegesburg district of Rotterdam. Gillis le Fèvre de Montigny had
recently been appointed to this promising position after serving for
several years in a smaller, less notable district where he had
nevertheless made the right impression. Brother Johan eased himself into
the social benefit afforded by his association with Gillis and merged
with the invited guests.

Paulina and Marcellus worked their way through the crowd to be near Theo
as he delivered his formal speech, declared the station open and, after
others had made their speeches, led the assembled party into the
restaurant where they were seated for the meal. Paulina found that her
appetite was unusually slight and that her eyes constantly sought out
Johan, who seemed to have been been made room for at the end of a table,
near the door. His brother sat next to him and appeared to be animatedly
monopolising his attention. Occasionally they would look in her
direction and she would quickly look away but just sometimes her eyes
met Johan's only and they held each other's gaze unabashed. Mostly,
however, she was able to take him in as he devoted his attention to his
food and his brother. He was every bit as handsome as she remembered and
stirred her passion no less now that he has was out of his uniform and
in a smart tailcoat and suit.

For her own part, she was glad that she had put on her favourite
carriage dress with its flatteringly cut jacket in a darker blue to the
full-skirted, lightweight dress beneath. It was quite a new costume and,
she had been assured by the dressmaker, fashionable. As was the Mantilla
which she had been persuaded would complete the look. But Paulina found
that her boisterous hair defeated all attempts to attach the flimsy
Spanish creation which, in any case, made her feel uncomfortably tall as
it's comb added a good hand's breadth to her height. She had tossed the
Mantilla into a drawer at home and was now relieved not to have the
worry of it.

The meal over, people began to leave the table and pass out of the
restaurant. The train for Rotterdam was due at any moment so
leave-takings began. Theo and Marcellus passed among the Rotterdam
guests, shaking hands and saying a few well-chosen words to each of
them. Paulina tried to keep up with them and do as they did but was
finding it difficult to connect socially with any of the men. She might
have felt aggrieved by their overlooking her but was distracted from the
whole enterprise when she noticed that Johan and his brother were
heading through the throng in her direction. She then focussed her own
efforts on managing matters so that Marcellus was at hand when the
brothers arrived before her.

Before Paulina could concern herself with including her father in the
introductions she found that Gillis le Fèvre de Montigny had taken this
social manoeuvre upon himself, deftly separating the four of them into a
discrete group away from the mass of people. Gillis drew upon a slight
previous acquaintance with Marcellus and the latter's current mood of
fellowship to all around in order to engage his attention. Once he had
ensured that all four were known to each other and a cordial atmosphere
prevailed, he swiftly moved on to issue an invitation to dine at his new
house in Hillegesburg. Marcellus explained that the family were waiting
upon a new arrival so his wife would not be travelling far in the near
future. Most extraordinarily, Marcellus then heard himself issue an
invitation for the le Fèvre de Montignys to take lunchewon at Haastrecht
the following week. The invitation was readily accepted, a date and time
agreed and hasty farewells made as the Rotterdam train was now standing
at the platform with Johan's luggage being loaded aboard.

Once released from his civic duties, Theo had prevailed upon Marcellus
and Paulina to come into the house and take refreshment with Aggie
whilst Paulina's luggage was being stowed on the carriage. Once the
sisters were together it was inevitable that an account of Johan's
presence at the station opening should burst from Paulina. Marcellus,
being a good natured man and exceedingly fond of his daughter, joined in
with their excitement, proclaiming,

``I do believe that you are a little enamoured of this gentleman!''

To the surprise of all present Paulina announced,

``Yes, father. He is the man I am going to marry!''

\subsection{}

Everyone had been somewhat taken aback by Paulina's announcement but the
tone of determination in her voice brooked of no contrary comments. Such
a brief acquaintance seemed hardly the basis for a life-long commitment
and would usually have been dismissed as a passing fancy. However, in
the circumstances there was an element of relief as it was proving
difficult to find a suitable husband for her. Many tactful introductions
had been made over the years since she came of age but she had shown no
interest in forming any sort of attachment either romantically or
pragmatically.

It had not been easy to entice eligible bachelors in Paulina's
direction, either. She was somewhat out of the ordinary in her physical
appearance, being both tall and sturdy, as well as lacking in any dress
sense or gracefulness. She was educated to manage her inheritance but
not accomplished in literature, music or art and spoke no foreign
languages. Although she spent hours each day at her writing desk, the
result was perhaps best described as mental outpourings.

Paulina's enthusiasm for this man at least got over the first hurdle on
the course towards marriage. However, two major stumbling blocks
remained. Was this relative stranger a suitable person to be the husband
of the only daughter of a wealthy and powerful patrician. Paulina stood
to inherit a great deal of property in her own right but could only
retain her father's power if she had a husband to act on her behalf.
Even assuming his credentials passed scrutiny, there was the small
matter of whether Johan Jacob le Fèvre de Montigny was actually
interested in marrying Paulina.

Because of these concerns, Marcellus made a point of having a private
talk with Theo before leaving for Haastrecht. The two men pooled what
little they knew of Paulina's potential suitor, starting with their
shared assumption that he came from a family with an illustrious
military past. That said, they next agreed that the brothers Gillis and
Johan appeared to have been born in obscurity but to be men of means;
where, they wondered, had this money come from? Theo was also privy to
the rumours circulating at parliament in Den Haag concerning the dubious
morals of the King's eldest son, Hendrik the Navigator. Johan's name had
been mentioned as one of the set who joined in the Prince's notorious
bouts of drinking and womanising. Neither man was keen to ally their
innocent Paulina to a man of dissolute habits.

Doubts clouded the enthusiasm of father and brother-in-law for Paulina's
choice of husband and they saw it as their duty to find out more before
matters progressed too far. Not only did they wish to spare Paulina the
pain of future disillusionment, but they were also eager to avoid any
scandal which association with the wrong sort of man might bring down
upon their heads. It was agreed that Theo would quickly pay a visit to
Den Haag where he knew of a clever and discrete man whom he would engage
to investigate and report back directly on the young lieutenant.

\section{Juli 1869}

\subsection{}

The man waiting patiently at the edge of the room was quite
unremarkable. He could neither be described as tall nor short, thick-set
nor thin, dark nor fair and he wore clothes that were neither rough nor
elegant. His features were unremarkable, his stance relaxed and
confident without being in any way challenging. Like a moth on a wall at
dusk, you would not notice him until, that is, he moved. Then his talent
for mimicry displayed itself in far more complex and dynamic ways than
were available to any insect. His movements and gestures could mirror
those of the people around him, as could his voice, accent and
expressions. Upon first meeting him almost anyone would feel the sort of
rapport that presages a lifelong friendship, yet you could pass him in
the street unrecognised within an hour of taking him into your heart --
and confidence.

His plain clothing concealed a muscular and agile body that was well
able to deal with trouble of a physical kind, as well as a short-bladed
knife and small pistol which he could apply with skill should the
necessity arise. Fortunately, no such circumstance had arisen in the
conduct of this particular case, yet, despite its apparently
straightforward and safe nature, this matter had caused him some
perturbation. Viruly was not his only client and there were more
powerful interests with far fatter purses which had to be taken into
account when presenting his report.

As was usual in these circumstances, the man would give his findings
verbally. He had previously ordered his thoughts on paper then, blessed
with a photographic memory, destroyed any trace of written material
before presenting himself before his client. The man's stoic wait was
eventually rewarded when the door to the room opened and closed as
Viruly entered his Den Haag office. Even so, it wasn't until Viruly had
settled himself behind the desk that he became aware of the man's
presence, feeling rather discomforted at being caught unawares. The man
gave Viruly an arch look and continued to wait in silence until Viruly
got up and crossed the room in order that an envelope of bank notes
could be transferred from Viruly's inside coat pocket to that of the
man.

Viruly seated himself behind the desk once more and gestured to the man
that he should take the visitor's seat opposite him but the man
indicated that he preferred to stand. He moved forward into the
spotlight of sunshine let in by the window as a signal that he was ready
to begin his narrative. So far, not a word had been uttered by either
party and Viruly was unwilling to be the one to break the oddly monastic
atmosphere so, instead of speaking, he elected to open the palm of his
right hand and extend it in front of him as an invitation to the other
to start what was clearly set up to be an uninterrupted soliloquy. The
account which followed was delivered without embellishment or dramatic
interpretation, the man reading the words from the inside of his
expressionless eyes. Its listener was left to interpret what he heard
for himself and form what judgement he may of the individual it
concerned.

``The subject, Johan Jacob le Fèvre de Montigny, is the second living
son of Johan Jacob le Fèvre de Montigny, after whom he was named, and
Petronella Henrietta Kleijn. His father was called to the ministry of
the Nederlandse Hevormde Kerk as a young man and all his family practice
that religion.''

``He has one surviving older brother, Gillis Johannes le Fèvre de
Montigny, named after his grandfather. This brother was born in 1837 in
the village of Kwadijk in the Zeevang community of North Holland, his
father being the pastor resident there. A second child, Bartolomeus,
born in 1938, did not survive infancy. The family were quite short of
funds at this time.''

``In 1839 the family moved to Nieuwe Tonge in the community of
Middleharnis on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in South Holland. Here
Johan Jacob junior was born in 1840 and another child, Henri Pieter,
arrived some years later.''

``Johan Jacob senior was predikant of the parish of Nieuwe Tonge for the
remainder of his lifetime, his fortunes improving such that he was
registered as a landowner at his death in 1849. It is said that his new
parish was granted as the result of the application of both power and
money on the part of his parents. Nieuwe Tonge was certainly an
improvement on Kwadijk in both location, being close to his family, and
in possessing an environment more favourable for both physical and
financial health. However, his choice of profession is rather at odds
with the occupations of the rest of his well-respected patrician
family.''

``The subject's grandfather, Gillis Johannes senior, married Lena van
der Sluys in 1807 at Zwartewaal, near Brielle on the island of
Voorne-Putten in South Holland. They had two daughters and two sons who
survived into adulthood. The daughters, who are the eldest children,
married well. Maria Johanna wed Arij Jacobusz Hogendijk, a shipowner and
merchant, and lives in Vlardingen. The Hogendijks are a clan of
shipbuilders and builders in the area of Krimpen aan den IJssel. Jacoba
Elena wed Johannes Oudorp Kotebrant who was appointed mayor of Kralingen
near Rotterdam in 1867. The Oudorp family also has connections in the
East Indies. A fourth and youngest child, Jacob known as Jacques,
requires money for his care and always lives with a family member. He
was in the home of Lena van der Sluys until her death in 1859, some 38
years after her husband, at Oudendijk. Jaques now lives with the
Kralingen branch of the family but it has not been possible to discover
what ails him.''

``The subject's grandfather, Gillis Johannes le Fèvre de Montigny was
born at Den Bosch in North Brabant in 1765 and died at Maasluis in South
Holland in 1821. In 1776 he became a Kornet in the Regiment
Oranje-Gelderland. By 1782 he had risen to the rank of Kolonel in the
Korps Ingenieurs which became Korps der Genie in 1806 then the
Koninklijk Korps der Artillerie en Genie in 1807. He is noted and
respected for his work in map-making and, less so, for the design of
defensive structures. In 1806 he was appointed examiner of surveys to
the land register. The Koninklijk Korps der Artillerie en Genie closed
in 1810 after French came to power but Kolonel le Fèvre de Montigny was
one of the few to retain his rank in the French army.''

``Thus from 1810 -- 1811 the Kolonel was \emph{chef de battailion} 1e
Klasse. He was designated premier administrator to Hollandse cadaster
which surveyed and mapped the Netherlands in order to create the land
register which was to form the basis of new tax laws on property. He
held this post until 1817 and is best known for the quality of his work
and for taking a principled stand over standardization and detail in his
surveys. This was deemed both costly and irrelevant by those in charge
of the project but le Fèvre de Montigny stood fast and overcame this
opposition to oversee the production of the first set of detailed and
accurate maps of our country.''

``The subject's grandfather had followed in the military footsteps of
his own father, Johan Nicolaas le Fèvre de Montigny, who joined the
Korps Ingenieurs as a Kornet 1776 and rose to the rank of
Lieutenant-Kolonel in 1795. Johan Nicolaas became Directeur of
Nederrijn- en IJssellinie defensive works, for which he produced the
first accurate maps of Overijssel and Zeeland.''

``To return to more recent events. The subject and two brothers were
still minors in the care of their mother, Petronella Henrietta Kleijn,
when their grandmother, Lena van der Sluys, died in 1857. At this point
the three pastor's sons inherited a significant amount of money, being
their father's share of the estate. The subject's grandmother owned a
great deal of land around Brielle which was sold by her heirs and the
proceeds apportioned between them. The subject's mother did not benefit
from this inheritance and died some years later at the age of fifty
three. I could find no trace of the younger brother after that event.''

``At the time that he benefited from his inheritance the older brother,
Gillis Johannes, was employed as a candidate notary in Den Haag. After
his grandmother's death he moved to Brielle then, in 1864, gave up the
law and went to live in Berkel near Rotterdam, having been appointed
burgemeester of Berkel and Rodenrijs at the end of the previous year.
Gillis Johannes has recently been appointed burgemeester of
Hillegersberg and Bergschenhoek, which neighbours his previous
constituency yet is more favourably located for development as a
substantial centre of business and an elegant residential area. It would
seem that the subject's brother has used his new-found wealth and his
ancestor's influential name in order to progress a career in politics.
In 1866 he married Maria Woutherina van Haaften in Den Haag. To date, he
has one son, an infant given the family names of Johan Jacob. He has
just built a substantial villa in Hillegersberg where the subject is
also currently residing.''

``As to the subject's biography, he attended a private elementary school
in Hilversum then, aged 14, commenced training as a sea-going officer in
the navy. The reasons for his taking this course of action rather than
following the family preference for the military are not known. The
Naval Training School in Den Helder did not exist at that time so our
subject's training was arranged as a private matter between the family
and appropriate sea captains. Perhaps the influence of his family
background set him on the course of becoming a navigation officer.''

The man smiled wryly to himself behind his stony face as he examined his
client for any sign that his little pun had been appreciated. He often
played such a small trick at this point in his monologues in order to
discover whether his audience had been, and still was, attending to all
that he laid before them. It was frequently the case, especially in
matrimonial affairs, that the client was listening for a particular
piece of information and not taking in the whole picture. However, this
employer evidenced himself to be a model of diligence by the merest
lightening of his expression at the man's slight whimsy. Thus, coming to
the meat of the matter, the man continued,

``The subject's first voyage of any length was as a Kornet on the
Frigate \emph{Admiral van Wassenaar} from 1855 to 1856. During another
two-year voyage from 1857 to 1859, also on a Frigate, he was promoted to
Adelborst. Then he served on the transport ship \emph{De Heldin} which
sailed from Hellevoetsluis to the West Indies, being promoted to
Lieutenant ter Zee der 2e Klasse in 1859. In connection with his
voyages, he has purchased many charts and maps, including of Java, the
Batta countries and Sumatra in the East Indies, as well as inheriting
many maps from his forbears.''

``At the age of twenty two he left the navy and began to live variously
in hotels in Den Haag, Amsterdam and Gouda as well as with his brother
near Rotterdam. He has made substantial investments using the firm of
Jonas \& Krugeman in Amsterdam, including a particularly successful
venture in the Koninklijke Stoomboot Maatschappij. He is a member of Den
Haag Freemason's lodge and The Amsterdam branch of the public welfare
organisation Maatschappij tot Nut van het Algemeen. He has never married
and no scandal attaches to his name.''

The man stopped speaking and looked directly at Viruly. An interval
elapsed during which Viruly tried to formulate his thoughts for the
response which was clearly expected. In the end he simply said,

``If I understand you correctly, Lieutenant le Fèvre de Montigny comes
from a lesser branch of a notable patrician family. He is of the
Nederlandse Hevormde Kerk protestant religion, possessed of some wealth
and a member of suitably worthy organisations. He has never married and
has no independent household.''

The man nodded his confirmation. Viruly continued,

``Does he have any particular friends?''

The man knew that not even the smallest grain of the truth must dust his
answer,

``The subject has an easy social manner which has engaged many
acquaintances but he has formed no particular friendships. His
relationship with his brother has endured and indicates that he has the
potential to form deep and lasting attachments.''

This answer had only skimmed the surface of Viruly's most serious
concern so he felt that he must press further,

``You say that no scandal attaches to his name but you do not offer any
more detailed assessment of his character. I should be interested to
hear your opinion of him as a man.''

The man had prepared his answer, having expected such a line of enquiry.
He knew that he needed to tread carefully in what he said but that say
something he must if the fact of his manipulating his information were
not to be suspected. To reveal too much would, however, put him in
jeopardy of losing valuable clients and perhaps even put him in the way
of a more physical sort of danger.

``The subject is a sailor and a bachelor who has been in the habit of
going where he pleases and suiting himself. Many of his connections are
people who share his charitable, business and religious interests and
others are naval colleagues. He is accepted into polite society wherever
he goes.''

``I should perhaps mention that there has lately been an alteration in
his usual behaviours which might be interpreted as indicating that he
has come to a time in his life where he is ready to settle down and take
a wife, should he find someone suitable. For instance, I have heard that
he has very recently made enquiries as to the purchase of a house
presently under construction in a fashionable part of The Hague.''

The man left his answer there, knowing that he had avoided the moral
quagmire before him yet safely achieved the crux of the matter that
occupied the client before him. He had subtly alluded to the suitability
and availability of the subject for marriage to the Bisdom van Vliet
daughter, which was all that Viruly had really wanted to know and what
one of his other interests had wished him to convey.

The man made a slight bow and was gone with hardly a disturbance to the
air in the room. Viruly immediately took up a sheet of writing paper,
pen and ink and wrote a short message to Marcellus using the form of
words which they had agreed upon as a confirmation that Paulina's choice
of husband was considered a suitable one. Sealing the letter, Viruly
rang for a boy to take it to the post. Marcellus would have the news he
was waiting for by the end of that afternoon.

As soon as the message left his hand Viruly began to feel less certain
of it's content. Now that the man had gone taking his stage presence
with him, and Viruly had dropped his own guard of rationality and
returned to being Theo, the concerned brother-in-law, some sense of
unease crept over him. He tried to focus on what was bothering him but
all he was left with were vague ~suspicions too insubstantial to bear
close scrutiny. Was the father a noble man who followed his religious
convictions at the cost of wealth and power, or was he in some way the
black sheep of the family? Is there some inherited family weakness
behind the shadowy figures of the uncle known as Jacques and the younger
brother, Henri Pieter? For all he knew, the latter might have had a
dashing military career and been killed in action.

Then there was the man himself. Theo had to admit that he just didn't
like Johan and that this coloured his enthusiasm for the match with
Paulina. Quite why his instincts told him to keep his distance from the
dashing, young Lieutenant he couldn't fathom. Perhaps it was just his
own fondness for the girl that made it hard for him to see any man as
good enough for her. Then again, his political and business dealings had
been a great education in the ways of men and he was well aware that the
investigator had presented a well-manicured account for political
reasons. Gillis had some of this skill, too, but Johan seemed to lack
this political acumen, although he clearly had a head for business which
Theo was able to appreciate. There was something else that motivated the
young man in his social dealings, something that Theo felt was beyond
his range of understanding. Something that was probably best left to the
women in the family to fathom.

\subsection{}

Once back at Haastrecht, preparations for the luncheon consumed a great
deal of Paulina's emotional energies. Everything seemed to conspire
against her, however, and she was often in an agony of anxiety that
things would not be as she desired or, unthinkably, the invitation would
have to be postponed or even cancelled. Firstly, her mama had to be
persuaded to leave Aggie's side and return to Haastrecht for the
occasion. It was not so much that Maria Elizabeth could not tear herself
away from De Haven for even one day, although that was the impression
that she gave. It was, if truth be told, a rather less noble sentiment
that motivated her -- she had moved heaven and earth to find a suitable
husband for her youngest daughter only to be thwarted by this wilful
child. Now, the girl had gone and found a man all by herself, putting
her mother's nose well and truly out of joint. Since Paulina had made it
clear that she was taking over all her mother's duties in her absence
and brooked no interference, she could have the responsibility of
organising her own luncheon party for all her mother cared about it.

Paulina was delighted to have control of the event but suffered greatly
until her mother relented and agreed to attend. Then she was on
tenterhooks waiting for a formal response to their written invitations
to Johan and Gillis and his wife which was delayed somewhat because the
baby, Johan Jacob junior, was suffering from some childhood ailment and
his mother could not bear to be parted from him. At last, the news came
that all was well so the luncheon could go ahead as arranged. Now
Paulina could get on with the tasks of planning and organising with
which she was in her element.

Wanting to make a good impression, she decided on a formal meal in the
'new' part of the house, that is to say the part built by her great
great great grandfather when he came to Haastrecht in 1694. Usually more
informal meals were taken in the original 'family house' adjoining it,
parts of which dated back to the 16th century. Although the family house
was more cosy and intimate, Paulina wanted her future husband to
experience the style in which she expected to spend her married life.

Her first task was to decide with the butler on the table setting. There
was no doubt in her mind but that the Meissen porcelain dinner service
should be used for she adored it's delicate pink floral pattern with a
simple gold band around the rim. She had a fondness for porcelain in
general, fashionably aspiring to a great collection of it one day. To
accompany the dinner service she chose the solid silver Sheffield
cutlery, of course. To dress the table she ordered vases of flowers and
the bringing out the new silver and crystal glass garnishments which
she, Aggie and Theo had bought for her parents on the occasion of their
silver wedding anniversary a few years previously. Silver pedestals
supported crystal fruit platters, compote dishes and
\emph{bonbonnières}, their edges dripping with crystal tear-drops which
would shimmer in the candlelight from the best silver candelabra. The
tiered centre piece would set off the whole ensemble to perfection and
leave her guests in no doubt but that they were sitting at the table of
a well-to-do family. Her next project was to decide on the food and
wines that would garce her magnificent table setting.

She hated relying on the staff for advice but soon realized that she had
to do so. Paulina made a list of her favourite dishes and created an
opulent but ungainly menu which made cook throw her hands up in despair
when it reached the kitchen. Cook was not a woman to be beaten, however,
so she took up her pencil and re-worked Paulina's offering to her own
satisfaction. Dishes which clashed were separated and those involving
unseasonable or unobtainable ingredients, as well as those which were
time-consuming or likely to overtax even her skills, were amended or
replaced. This revised menu was then taken to the young mistress for
final approval, the changes being tactfully explained. Luckily, Paulina
was delighted with the result and had no trouble accepting that she had
a lot to learn about what went into the creation of a successful menu.

When it came to choosing the wines to accompany the meal Paulina knew
from the start that she was out of her depth. She understood that the
wines served at a dinner were usually judged by the men at least as
keenly as the table was by the women. The trouble was that she wouldn't
know a good wine from a bottle of vinegar as she drank but little. In
fact, she quite disapproved of alcohol but had so far kept this to
herself. She had seen enough of the effects of drunkenness amongst the
poor of the village to last a lifetime but was not yet able to
disentangle the circumstances of poverty and the availability of cheap
gin from the ease of plenty and the pleasures of fine wines. The only
alcohol she allowed to pass her lips was the sweet, red vermouth she had
been introduced to in Italy a few years previously. She realized that
this version of a wine was an eccentric taste of hers and not something
that she could expect her guests to drink throughout the meal.

The French had left behind their habit of wine drinking when they
retreated back within their own borders in 1815 but the notion of
keeping a private supply at home had not taken hold with the Dutch.
Unlike the hot and dry lands of wine-producing France, the wet soil of
the Netherlands was not conducive to the undermining of buildings with
cellars which the temperate climate, in any case, rendered unnecessary.
Paulina summoned her father's favourite wine merchant to discuss placing
an order. They went through the menu together, the merchant suggesting
wines to compliment each dish. When the cost of the order was reckoned
up Paulina was horrified and the whole process had to be gone through
again but with an eye to economy this time. Somehow she just couldn't
bring herself to pay the prices of some of the best wines, no matter how
much she wished to impress her guests.

All these preparations did not distract her from her duties to the
family estates. She enjoyed keeping detailed and accurate accounts of
all the incomings and outgoings, keeping a tight grip on all the monies
brought to the house by a constant stream of tennants as well as
carefully monitoring the household expenses. There was also the business
of sending written instructions to the various tradesmen who were
required to make repairs and alterations to all the properties. Aside
from such routine matters, Paulina concerned herself with the physical
and moral welfare of the sick and poor of the district who either came
to the door or were commended to her by the predikant. Once word got
round that the young (and, so it was assumed, inexperienced) woman of
the family was in sole charge, there was an increase in the number of
petitioners but Paulina was determined that she should not be hoodwinked
into giving charity to the undeserving so turned a deaf ear to some of
the more outrageous tales of woe.

It was exhausting work which left little time for socializing with her
good friends Helena and Cornelia Droost and Mientje Blankken, although
they only lived a step or two away. Letter writing of a personal nature
was confined to uncharacteristically brief communications with her
mother, step-sister and a married friend who now lived in Aachen. Her
father was out of the house most of the time, occupied with his business
concerns and his civic duties which often involved long hours of travel
on top of the difficult situations he had to deal with and the important
decisions he needed to take. In fact, Paulina's most constant companion
during this period was her journal in which she wrote avidly at every
available moment, dashing off line after line in her large and flowing
hand using a pencil for speed rather than the more complex demands of
pen and ink. She was always to judge that the hhat thoughts which she
commited to paper during these few weeks in July were the most revealing
and significant of all her writings.

\subsection{}

The day of the luncheon seemed to come round very quickly so that,
before she knew it, Paulina was being helped into her best day dress by
her maid. Her mother and father had both returned to Haastrecht during
the morning and were now also dressing ready to receive guests. The
household staff were quietly and calmly going about thier tasks. All was
well and even the sun was shining for Paulna's luncheon party.

Marcellus was in his office attending to the post which had ccumulated
during his brief absence and Paulina and her mother were going over the
accounts together when their guests arrived by cab from Gouda station.
By the time Johan, Gillis and Mary had descended from the vehicle the
Bisdom van Vliet family had made thier way to the vestibule to greet
them. The sight of Johan almost took Paulina's breath away, which came
as something of a relief as it woud have been rather socially awkward
had her feelings towards him suddenly changed.

The luncheon passed well with both Mary and her mother complimenting the
tastefully laid table whilst all the men were appreciative of the choice
of wines. Everyone enjoyed the plentiful food whose many courses kept
them at the table until well into the afternoon. As to conversation, the
men had much to talk about since, despite all being liberal in their
political persuasion, they had somewhat differing views on a number of
issues which needed debating. Meanwhile, the women talked about children
and household matters which, having neither, rather left Paulina on the
outside. Her attention tended to drift towards Johan who deftly included
her in his audience when he came onto the topic of his passion for the
new steamships which, he predicted, would replace the use of wind power
entirely within the next decade. His knowledge of the sea and enthusiasm
for the new industry of building ships using metal rather than wood and
engines rather than sail captivated her with his manliness.

Once the party had eaten their fill, Paulina suggested that they took
tea or coffee outside in the landscaped grounds across the lane to the
front of the house. Whilst the ladies made their way to the table and
chairs which had already been set up in the shade of a large Copper
Beech tree, the men retired to Marcellus's office where he offered them
cognac and a choice of cigars from the three factories in Haastrecht.
Gillis discretely left his brother alone with Marcellus once the
comparison of cigars and cognacs had been discussed for a polite length
of time. He made his way slowly through the house and out into the
gardens where he found the ladies taking their tea cold against the heat
of the afternoon, a habit from the East Indies which had now become
fashionable back in Holland.

The private conversation between Marcellus and Johan did not take long.
As Marcellus had expected, Johan formally requested his permission to
pay court to Paulina using the words so carefully coached by brother
Gillis. Marcellus asked Johan what his prospects were, as if he didn't
already know, and made out to be modestly rassured by hearing of his
considerable income from investments, his possible earnings from future
sea voyages and the building of a fashionable house in Den Haag which
would make a suitable family home, in due course. Marcellus made a show
of giving his blessing with the caveat that Paulina herself should be
agreeable to Johan's attentions, again he was privately sure that she
was more than willing.

Once reunited and everyone had drunk their fill of the various
beverages, Marcellus proposed a stroll in the gardens. This provided him
with an opportunity to let his guests see in the flesh, as it were, the
stylish landscaping that they had already admired as the setting for the
1757 family portrait of great grandfather Theodorus, with his wife and
ten children. Marcellus privately held this forebear of his to be his
role model. Theodorus was the first to be appointed burgemeester of
Haastrecht at the begining of the 18th century, a role which had been
handed down through the Bisdom van Vliet men in an uninterrupted line
ever since. Successful in business, Theodorus had been wealthy enough to
be able to buy up lands around Haastrecht, which included the castle
Sloot van Vliet which enabled him to engrandise the family name from the
simple Bisdom of his father, Adriaan. On the home front, Theodorus had
built a new wing onto the house and commissioned the Royal Gardener to
lay out the grounds. Then, to top it all, he had fathered twelve
children almost all of whom had survived to adulthood without the losses
in infancy and childhood which were usual.

Marcellus had inherited the family interests at the tender age of
nineteen and at a time when the Golden Age of Dutch prosperity from
overeseas trade was long gone. It had been as much as he could do to
hold onto his inheritance let alone lay out money on house, garden or
land. He had married Maria when he was thirty three and under some
pressure for his mother to provide heirs. His fancy was taken by the
widow Ledeboer who also lived on the Hoogstraat , and who brought lands
ajoining his, as well as her three surviving children, to their union.
As time was to tell, Maria's age (she three years older than him) was to
lead to disappointment. They only had one child, Paulina, and this
shortly after their marriage in 1839. Now he once more found himself
cajoaled by his mother, now aged eighty three, into finding a husband
for Paulina before her child-bearing years had dwindled much further. A
male heir was what was needed, especially now that Marcellus could feel
the economic tide in Holland turning to the flood making a second Golden
Age seemed possible. Today, he felt his hopes rise.

Whilst Marcellus conducted his guided tour of the lake, the statues of
Hercules and Neptune and all the specimon trees, Paulina and Johan hung
back under the pretext of inspecting in the Copper Beeches which Adriaan
had planted to mark the birth of his first two sons, Jacob in 1696 and
Theodorus in 1698. The pair pursues their interest in Copper Beeches by
returning to the small, formal garden behind the house where Adriaan had
planted his own tree upon first arrival in Haastrecht in 1694. They
wandered down to the water's edge where the River Ijssel bounded the
edge of the property. Here, in this public private place, Johan took the
opportunity to speak his well=rehearsed lines.

"I do hope that I shall not be presuming too much upon such a short
acquaintance as ours if i say that I am already at ease in your company.
Would it be too much to hope that you might one day feel comfortable
with me?"

Paulina could hardly keep herself from jumping into the middle of his
declaration with fulsome affirmations that she reciprocated any positive
feelings he might have for her. However, she, too, had been carefully
prepared against the possibility of just this situation occuring. So,
instead she relied in as steady a manner as she could manage,

" I, too, have felt that there is a naturalness to our meetings."

Taking his cue, Johan responded,

"Then might I hope that we might meet together more often and get to
know eachother further?"

"I should like that very much."

"Then it will be my pleasure to call upon you as often as you will
permit me to. In the meantime, I think that it is your birthday soon and
wish to offer you a gift"

With this, Johan produced a small package from his inside coat pocket
and handed it to Paulina.

"It is just a small token of my esteem which I hope will remind you of
me when we are apart."

Paulina unwrapped the present to find a tiny replica of a ship's cannon
made out of solid silver. Before she could master her feelings she felt
a flush of disappointment at such an unfeminine choice of gift. Hardly
had this almost reflex response had time to enter her awareness than it
was replaced in a more stable delight at his thoughtfulness. It also
thrilled to have a tangible token of her womanhood, a symbol of her
passage from unwanted spinster to a woman being paid court to by the man
she loves. After a heartbeat's delay, Paulina smiled up at Johan and
offered him her thanks - and her hand hand which he raised to his lips
and tenderly kissed, holding her gaze with his liquid brown eyes.

With that, it was done. Paulina Maria Bisdom van Vliet was about to be
courted by Johan Jacob le Fevre de Montigny. It was hard to think of
anything else to say now, so the couple just looked into each other's
eyes for a second or two before turning back to the house where they
quietly slid back inot the company of their families.

\subsection{}

The last day of June was Paulina's twenty-ninth birthday which made for
a constant stream of callers to the house. Villagers and tennants came
bearing the best of their produce that they could manage as a token of
their respect: fish, meat, eggs, bread, vegetables, fruit, cheese,
flowers and small pieces of various needlecrafts. Paulina stationed
herself on a chair behind the streetside window nearest to the main door
so that she could give a wive of acknowledgement to each departing
donor. More affluent well-wishers were the cause of frequent deliveries
by tradesmen and by post of more substantial gifts as well as some of
the newly fashionable cards. Soon every available space on top of
side-boards, buffets and small tables was filled, despite the
perishables having been conveyed to the pantry immediately.

Among the few callers actually admitted to the house were Paulina's
friends. First came Helena and Cornelia Droost who lived in the house
next door. The daughters of a wealthy Schoonhoven silver dealer, there
was twenty four years difference in the sisters' ages with Helena being
fourteen years older than Paulina and Cornelia ten years younger. Next
to arrive was Mientje Blanken, now nearing her fourtieth year, who lived
with her uncle, an important figure in the village and friend of
Paulina's father. Last, and in a flurry as usual, was Aaltje van Zijl
who was just in her twenties and the daughter of another local family of
substance. Aaltje's father was building the hofje, a courtyard of alms
houses, at the poor eastside of Hoogstraat. which was a project heartily
endorsed by Paulina's own father.

On being shown into the kleine salon each woman kissed Paulina three
times on alternating cheeks then tendered birthday good wishes. Everyone
had brought a gift so Paulina was engaged with paper and ribbon for some
minutes as she revealed writing materials and the latest novel, a pair
of white lace gloves and a silver-backed hand mirror, which Aaltje
assured her had come from Paris. Tea and delicate little cakes were
served and the women fell into comfortable conversation. With these
lifelong women friends gathered around her, it was not long before
Paulina found that she could no longer keep her important news to
herself;

"There have been developments in my acquaintace with Lieutenant le Fevre
de Montigny. I am now officially being courted by this gentleman!"

There was an immediate clamour of excitement and congratulations
followed by a great press of questions about when, where and how this
happy circumstance had come about as well as damands for every kind of
detail about the man himself. Paulina gleefully launched into an
unnecessarily fulsome account of events and an impassioned description
of Johan Jacob.

The two older women had long abandoned any hope of marriage for
themselves and it was with bitter-sweet feelings that they outwardly
enthused about Paulina's suitor, having privately considered her to be
destined to join them in spinsterhood. Cornelia and Aaltje, on the other
hand, were young and bright with romatntic expectations for thgemselves
which added a vicarious interest to their enquiries.

What started out for Paulina as the recounting of her story as if it
were a fairy-tale romance slowly changed in the telling. Her narrative
transformed from a description of a girl's cherished dream into a mature
woman's account of a real man and an actual possibility - no,
probability - that she would marry him. The atmosphere in the room
seemed to gradually become more calm, perhaps in response to Paulina's
increasingly down-to-earth tone. The older women exchanged glances as
both privately wondered if Paulina might be having second thoughts. But
before they had time to formulate discrete but probing enquiries, there
was a knock at the door and a maid came in bearing another gift.

This present was a rather large package with a long letter in Aggie's
hand accompanying it. Paulina laid the letter to one side to read at her
leisure once her guests had departed. She requested the maid to clear
the table of their now abandoned tea things and, once this had been
done, laid the parcel on it in order to remove the cord and paper
wrappings. What was revealed was a bolt of the finest silk satin fabric
in a stunning magenta. The other women crowded round the table to feel
the luxuriousness of the material and admire its rare colour. As Pauline
unrolled the first length of the silk the better for it to be
appreciated, a small square of paper fell out onto the floor. The maid,
who was lingering by the buffet too curious to leave the room, swiftly
retrieved the note from the floorand handed it to Paulina. The contents
were a brief, intensely private and personal communication which Paulina
took in at a glance before hastily secreting it beneath the discarded
wrapping paper. The note read:

"Dearest Paulina. This is for your bride dress. From your loving sister,
Aegidia."

A flush spread up Paulina's neck onto her cheeks and she remained quiet
and thoughtful as her friends compiled a list of all the features which
a gown in this most fashionable of colours should have. They began to
debate hoops as against horsehair petticoats, fringes as against
ruffles, wide sleeves as against narrow cuffs and whether a lace collar
or ribbons would be a flattering at the neck-line. In order to give
herself time to recover her composure, and to dispatch the maid from the
room, Paulina sent for the latest editions of \emph{Le Petit Courrier
des Dames} which Aggie so that the women could persue the complicated
draperies of the fashionable gowns illustrated therein.

\section{Vroeg August 1869}

\subsection{}

Johan was enjoying himself hugely. If he had been the sort of man to
reflect on life then it would have come as a surprise to him that he was
so pleasurably engrossed in his courtship of Paulina Maria. But he was
not that sort of man so spared not a second on such thoughts. Instead,
he gave himself up to the feeling of exhilaration that was the nearest
he had ever got on land to those times at sea when the ship was creaming
along on a running sea, sails full and it was his hands on the wheel.

To begin with he had been a reluctant suitor, already set in his
bachelor ways at the age of twenty eight. Feeling himself firmly steered
by both families onto his present course his independent spirit
threatened to rebel, to fight against their control, with the inevitable
result that the whole enterprise would have foundered. Disaster was
averted, however, when the warm winds of flattery swelled his ego and he
came round to his present and surprisingly comfortable heading. The
realisation that he was deemed worthy to have his name associated with
that of Marcellus Bisdom van Vliet, a man whose social stature and good
name in business were recognise the length of all the Great Rivers,
puffed up his pride by virtue of association.

Yet there was more to this change of tack in his courtship of Paulina
Maria than could be accounted for by mere flattery. Something in her
response to his attentions spoke directly to a need deep within him,
although he could not have said what this was. He had simply been going
through social motions of courtship until a means of extricating himself
presented itself, but Paulina Maria had been so receptive, so open and
so guileless in her reception of him that he had been quite won over by
her. Her obvious delight at everything he said and did drew him to her
in anticipation of an unbounded and uncritical love such as he had not
experienced since he was a boy at his mother's knee. That first feeling
of being loved so completely had ended abruptly upon the birth of his
sickly younger brother who survived to distract their mother with the
burden of his care. The untimely death of his father left her an
impoverished widow struggling to bring up three sons in a manner which
befitted their station in life. She had precious little emotional energy
left for her needy second child who was dispatched to school in
Hilversum and then into the Marine as soon as possible. Only now was
that unacknowledged abandoned child within the adult Johan awakened to
bask in the glow of the generous outpouring of adoration lavished upon
him by Paulina Maria.

There had been a lot of women passing through his life since Johan
entered the Marine as a youth but the pleasures of their company had
rarely left any lasting impression on him. If he had ever been drawn
back to any of them it could largely be accounted for by the ease of
their virtue. Indeed, one of the more pleasant aspects of his residence
at the Hotel De Zalm was the sweet and available maid-of-all-work who
was willing to help him unmake his bed in return for the small change he
left for her on the dresser. But nothing had ever recaptured for him
that feeling of being loved and wanted without qualification or demands
that he had lost so early in his life. Until now, that is, and with this
most unlikely of women who held no more physical attraction for him that
which was solely due to her sex.

Again, if he had been a man to ponder such things, Johan would have been
amazed at himself for the longing he felt for Paulina Maria's company.
Such was the soothing quality of his time spent with her that, had he
been able to name the emotion felt upon parting from her, he would have
called it grief. Paulina Maria never left him to suffer the agony of
loss for long, however, as she sent him a continuous stream of long
letters to which he eagerly responded. He often enclosed a new
photograph of himself in his uniform as he knew this would please her
and draw forth favourable comments in her next correspondence.

Thus it was with a glad heart that he viewed the prospect of spending
several days in her company at the Bisdom van Vliet house in Haastrecht.
He had arrived on the first Thursday in August to find that Marcellus
was away from home and not expected back until dinner time the next day.
Maria Elizabeth was, as usual, much taken up with the affairs of the
family's local properties and village interests. Paulina Maria normally
helped her mother with these tasks but had been released from most of
her duties in order to entertain their guest. The only call on her time
was the management of the household during Johan's visit, which she said
it was her pleasure to perform.

The weather was good on that first afternoon so he spent several happy
hours with Paulina Maria on his arm as they wandered through the
\emph{overtuin} across the lane from the house. They admired the new
planting which had been done, held imaginary conversations with the
impressive statues of Hercules and Neptune beside the lake, fancied
themselves explorers discovering the grotto on its island, then paused
to look at their reflections in the water and admire the view over the
farms to the windmills along the Vlist. Turning back towards the house,
they peeped in at the indoor plants being propagated in orangery but
found it much to hot and steamy inside to linger there for long.

They cooled down by taking cordials with Oma under the shade of the old
copper beech tree in the formal garden behind the house. The old lady,
now in her eighty-fourth year, had developed a tremor and Johan watched
tenderly as Paulina Maria helped the old lady to drink from her cup
without spills. Despite this physical sign of her advanced age, Oma
seemed keen to show an interest in him and soon got him telling stories
about his naval exploits. When the couple rose to leave Oma took
advantage the social \emph{largesse} granted to those of advanced years
when delivering her parting shot to the couple,

"Now don't leave it too long, will you? We need children to keep the
family going!"

\subsection{}

As he lay alone in the old-fashioned cupboard bed in his room in the
\emph{familiehuis}, old Oma's words came back into Johan's head. Up to
this point he had only been dimly aware of the connection between
courtship and marriage, having taken more notice of scandalous
relationships than the more conventional ones. His courtship of Paulina
Maria seemed to be a thing in and of itself its destination lost on the
hazy horizon of the future. Suddenly the mists cleared and he saw with
crystal clarity that everyone expected him to marry her and father her
children.

Gilles had laid out clearly for him the expected progression from first
meetings to formal application to pay court followed by the courtship
itself leading up to the making of an offer of marriage. The actual goal
of being married had, however, remained vague. Johan understood that a
wedding marked the transition from the groom being an unattached
bachelor to being a husband bound to one woman for life. Perhaps Gilles
had rashly assumed that his brother comprehended the state of matrimony
as well as he did himself, especially as Johan was a frequent visitor to
Gilles and Maria's home where he could directly observe the
well-regulated conduct of married life taking place. It might have
appeared that no further elaboration of the duties and obligations
involved in being a husband and father was required.

Thus it was that without a trace of hesitation or doubt Johan decided
that, yes, he could live permanently with the way Paulina Maria made him
feel! More than that, he could no longer contemplate life without her,
the very thought of which now made him rather panic-stricken. Having
reached the conclusion that he wanted her for his wife, Johan's
certainty about her feelings for him suddenly began to slowly ebb away
allowing the reefs of his insecurity to emerge. He drew comfort from the
agony of uncertainty by snuggling down into a nest of soft mattress,
feather pillows and voluminous covers. He resolved to ask for her hand
as soon as an opportunity arose, before she had time to cool towards
him. Yes, that is what he must do!

Having resolved on taking this course, Johan's thoughts moved on to the
topic of children. The connection between sex and unwanted pregnancy,
not to mention certain unmentionable diseases, had long been familiar to
him. The link between marriage, sex and the inevitability, and even
desirability, of procreation was something new for him to contemplate.
Now he began to toss around the notion of sex for insemination rather
than simply for pleasure and relief. He began to try to imagine what it
would be like having conjugal relations with Paulina Maria. It was
difficult for him to think of her in that way but Oma had made it clear
for him that he was to stand stallion for the Bisdom van Vliet blood
line. He exercised his highly developed libidinous faculties to conjure
up a vision of what lay beneath the chaste layers of Paulina Maria's
clothing. He anticipated the feel of her naked breasts under his hands,
finding them just as he liked breasts to be, large yet firm. His member,
already tingling pleasurably, now stiffened as his imaginings shifted to
the warm, moist cleft between her legs which promised to welcome him
inside. Now thoroughly aroused but with no opportunity for casual female
company, he had no other recourse than to seek the seaman's release.

Waking sometime later he climbed down from his bed, put on his dressing
gown and slippers then went in search of the night servant to ask for
brandy and a cigar to be brought to him. Thus provided for he settled
into an arm chair set before the open window and shutters. Johan tried
again to focus his thoughts on marriage and paternity as the night air
cooled his feverish imagination. He might have reflected upon the
suffering he witnessed as his parents buried yet another small coffin in
the Oude Tonge churchyard. Or recalled the distress of his brother,
Gilles, who could only wait impotently as Maria screamed for a whole
night and most of the following day to bring his namesake into the
world. Or he might have brought to mind the young life of his vibrant
cousin, Elisabeth, cut short in childbirth. As it was he reflected on
none of these sad events, nor did his lips form a smile at the
recollection of the joy children could also bring.

What actually came to his mind was the comforting thought of how little
the arrival of young Johan Jacob had altered Gillis's daily life. He was
still able to go about his affairs and travel from home without
hindrance. His prospective father-in-law was also a re-assuring case in
point, being hardly ever at home, or so it seemed. Johan would have been
loathe to curtail his activities for the sake of any child he might
father, finding it difficult to rest in any one place for long. His
resolve to marry Paulina Maria would have wavered had he felt his
freedom of movement might be in any way curtailed. Johan was thus able
to re-assure himself that he was not about to give up his liberty in any
real sense but, rather, was about to gain a secure emotional future and
a ready supply of sex whilst placing himself in an advantageous social
position into the bargain. Becoming fuddled with alcohol and tiredness,
he burrowed back into the surprisingly comfortable old bed and was soon
snoring fit to raise the roof.

\subsection{}

The following day dawned fine and warm, offering Johan the prospect of
again spending much of it out of doors, as was his preference. He missed
being on board ship, if not the discipline of life at sea. The day was
especially full of promise as he was to have Paulina Maria to himself
for several hours before they would be obliged to join her parents and
Oma for a family meal. Paulina Maria had appeared at breakfast wearing a
light gown with a rather lower neckline than was usual for her. The
flimsy dress in combination with the sheer, almost transparent, fabric
of the modesty scarf which covered the gap from \emph{decolletage} to
neck was enticingly suggestive of the ample bosom beneath, a choice of
attire which he regrettably attributed entirely to the hot weather and
not at all to a desire to raise any passion in him.

Once their coffee and bread had been taken, Paulina Maria announced that
she wanted him to accompany her to the stables in order to inspect the
new carriage horse that had been her birthday gift from her parents. She
suggested that afterwards they might have the horse harnessed to the
\emph{sjees} and take a drive along the dyke-top to the village of
Willige Langerak on the banks of the River Lek. It soon became clear to
him that horses and horse-drawn transport was a keen interest of hers,
but unfortunately one that he did not share.

Perhaps conditioned by his father's ill-humoured old nag, Johan had
grown up distrustful of horses, finding them alarmingly large, powerful
and unpredictable. The movement of their gangling legs made his feet
ache at the very thought of them getting caught between iron-shod hoof
and hard earth. Their strong jaws and massive teeth threatened to wreak
havoc with his flesh as their long necks seemed able to rotate their
huge heads in every conceivable direction, offering little hope of
escape. He fancied that their bulging eyes followed his every move with
nothing but evil intent in them, especially when the whites showed.
Altogether, he regarded the horse as a beast of wilful malevolence which
he could not believe capable of human subjugation and was thankful that
they had no place at sea.

With Paulina Maria's firm grip on his arm, Johan found himself propelled
towards the stables at a pace which brooked no hesitation. Fortunately
for the course of their courtship, his equine anxieties soon evaporated
with the moral heat created by the motion of Paulina Maria's breasts
which were thrust upwards by her corset and barely concealed by the
flimsiest of summer fabrics. Not only could he snatch surreptitious
glimpses of her magnificent \emph{decolletage} but he could also relish
the sensation of an occasional brush of clothed breast against his upper
arm, not to mention the insinuation of a sturdy thigh against his as she
strode along beside him despite the thickness of her horsehair
petticoats . All in all he found himself rendered incapable of uttering
anything coherent, let alone negative, on the subject of horses, being
so distracted that he could barely follow the thread of her bright
chatter. In his not trivial experience of women he had learnt that they
were all too aware of the physical signals they were sending through
these slight contacts and glimpses of barely concealed flesh. To his
delight, Johan took Paulina Maria to be flirting with him sexually!

Once they had arrived at the stables Paulina Maria bade the head ostler
lead out her new horse. Emerging from the gloom of her stall, the animal
started at the brightness of the external world causing Johan's heart to
lurch. The ostler soon calmed the mare with soft words and a gentle hand
then began to lead her up and down the yard for the admiration of her
visitors. The animal's coat gleamed in the sunshine, emphasising the
toned muscles that underlay her supple movements. The delicate way in
which she placed her feet and her responsiveness to the lightest touch
from the ostler began to entrance Johan. A tattoo beat out from the
man's clogs and the beast's iron shoes striking the cobbled ground as
the mare was put through her paces: walking, turning, trotting and
turning to walk past them again. Johan began to be mesmerised by the
sounds, by the oneness of man and mare, and by the sheer beauty and
grace of the animal.

Finally the ostler brought the horse to a halt before them making her
stand so as to be presented to best advantage for their inspection.
Following Paulina Maria's lead, Johan ran his hand along the animal's
neck, thrilling to the feel of her firm flesh beneath the warm, velvet
of her coat. He was given carrot and apple pieces to hold out on the
palm of his hand for the mare to take. The horse's breath was warm on
his skin as her soft lips delicately felt for the food before gently
lifting it from him with a watchmaker's precision. He found himself
fascinated by the fine skin and few long whiskers of her muzzle, by the
pulsating and deep nostrils that softly inhaled and exhaled, and by her
unfocused brown eyes which suggested nothing so much as a benign
character. Unable to resist exploring her face further, he ran his hand
over her forehead, ears, and mane before his enchantment was broken by
the ostler's discrete cough.

As the mare was led away to be put into harness, Johan turned to Paulina
Maria and offered her his arm for the return walk to the house. He found
her gazing into his eyes and smiling contentedly. His heart filled with
such joy that he could barely stop himself from acting without decorum.
He wanted to shout, to laugh loudly and to catch Paulina Maria up by the
waist and run with her. Self-control was necessary as their path soon
crossed with that of three servants traveling in an open cart with whom
greetings and cheery waves were exchanged. Paulina Maria explained that
a picnic was being sent on ahead and would be laid out ready for them to
take lunch when they got to her father's \emph{jachthuis} in Willige
Langerak. What a miracle of organisation she was, thinking of everything
and arranging it just so! He must have her as his wife!

\subsection{}

Johan's high spirits soon suffered a knock, however. He readied himself
to drive out then joined Paulina Maria to wait in the vestibule for
their transport to be brought to them, Paulina Maria having changed into
a different and more decorous outfit to suit the upcoming activity. A
clearly expensive and very ornately decorated \emph{sjees} appeared with
a uniformed groom leading the magnificent mare, who was now between the
delicate shafts of the carriage. Johan found himself fervently hoping
that he would not be required to take the driving seat. He could see
that the light, two-seater conveyance had no box for a coachman nor was
there a pair of horses to suggest that a postilion might appear and ride
the leader. Johan could barely sit a horse much less drive one so the
prospect of being put in charge of such a refined and costly rig as that
drawing up before him filled him with horror. Would Paulina Maria
consider it unmanly of him were he to decline to take the reins? Could
he avoid the shame of discovery if he were to conceal his shortcomings
behind an exhibition of bravado in the driving seat? Images of every
sort of carriage accident known to him passed before his mind's eye
causing his courage to take flight. A paralysis seized him such as he
had never known even in the worst of conditions at sea.

It was with a not inconsiderable measure of relief that Johan realised
that Paulina Maria was heading determinedly for the left seat in the
\emph{sjees}. Hastily mastering himself, Johan helped her up into the
carriage then walked round to the right side and climbed in himself.
Once they were settled, sitting close together as dictated by the lack
of space, Paulina Maria signalled to the man at the horse's head that
they were to set off. Soon they were on their way through the village
and onto the Vlisterdijk road towards Shoonhoven and it was only then
that she explained the rather unconventional seating arrangement as only
prudent with a relatively untried horse which had never pulled a
\emph{sjees} before or been driven by anyone in the household apart from
herself and her father. She wished to spare Johan the responsibility of
driving in these circumstances and hoped that he would not be offended.
He was not, he assured her, managing to present a graceful acceptance of
the imposed circumstances which avoided his having to confess his
shortcoming as a suitor.

As they passed slowly and sedately along the Hoogstraat, the men they
passed doffed their hats and women dipped little curtsies. Johan was
unaware of it but their route out of the village carefully avoided the
poorer dwellings to the east of the Grote Haven in favour of passing the
best houses and the thriving businesses. Just beyond the village they
came in sight of an octagonal windmill which Paulina Maria named for him
as Boezemmolen Number Six, which seemed a rather prosaic name for the
gracefully curved structure with its reed thatch top coat and almost
rakish 'tail' ladder. Looking ahead Johan could make out six or seven
more windmills along the River Vlist, although these were of a smaller,
simpler design. He remarked that the land below the dijk seemed still
quite waterlogged, even after the recent dry spell, voicing some
surprise that none of these drainage mills had their sails turning
despite a reasonable breeze having got up. Paulina Maria explained that
one of the other duties of the servants in the cart ahead of them had
been to instruct the millers to stop the sails until their \emph{sjees}
had passed. The Gouda to Schoonhoven Post Coach had also been held back
to let them go on ahead of it as well as any vagrants or beggars cleared
out of their path.

The way having been prepared for them, the journey passed most
pleasantly. Johan had all the mills and farms named for him and
anecdotes told about the local characters who inhabited them. It soon
became clear to him that Paulina Maria and her mother not only
controlled all that he could see with a firm business hand, they also
took an interest in the lives of their tenants. Families suffering
sickness and hardship received assistance so that none should be
destitute through no fault of their own. Although Paulina Maria did not
talk about this, he soon deduced for himself how delicate the balance
between water, wind and land was. As high tides and heavy rainfall
raised water levels in the River Vlist, which ran between the larger
rivers of the Ijssel and Lek and drew water from both of them, the land
would flood. If the wind to turn the mills did not come then it would
not be possible to pump the water off the land so it would remain
waterlogged. Animals would die, crops would fail and diseases thrive in
the stagnant water so that all who drank from it risked illness and even
death. Being at the mercy of wind and water was something he could
understand and came as a welcome antidote to the earlier social
shortcomings he had felt. It was just a pity that the mill arms had
their canvasses rolled up as he would have enjoyed hearing the rush of
the sails as the wind gave up its power to them and the wood of the mill
structures creak and groan in response to the motion.

His equilibrium restored, Johan now took advantage of their close
physical proximity and the time on their hands to pay attention to his
courtship of Paulina Maria. He began with the usual compliments on
appearance: the colour of her carriage dress bringing out the colour of
her eyes, the attraction of the fineness of her complexion, the inviting
shape and colour of her lips, and so on. He leant close to her so that
he could speak softly into her ear whilst considering how to slip his
arm around her waist, a liberty which would allow him to explore the
corsetry beneath her dress for its hints about the flesh beneath. She
seemed to accept his attentions with some warmth yet she did not respond
physically as he had anticipated she might, so he held back from
pressing her too far for fear of rejection. He fancied that Paulina
Maria was only feigning her concentration on driving out of decorum,
regarding himself as fortunate that she had her hands full with the
horse's reins and was constrained to be close to him by the confines of
the carriage.

Passing what seemed to be the last mill before coming to a village,
Johan rallied his interest as Paulina Maria told him about it. His
attentiveness was part courtship ploy as well as a half genuine enquiry
and turned out to be successful on both counts as the mill's long
history was recounted with some enthusiasm. The current Bonrepasmolen,
he was told, was the latest to be built on the site of the earliest mill
in South Holland, with the collapse of the access bridge and loss of
wind dogging the one attempt made to re-locate the mill to the opposite
side of the Vlist. Hearing them approaching, Miller Prins came out of
the reed-thatched pyramid of a house that he and his family occupied
beneath the wooden cap of the mill and proudly held up his baby son,
Arie, for the lady and her guest to admire. Paulina Maria caused the
\emph{sjees} to be halted briefly, producing a coin from some concealed
place in her skirts which she instructed Johan to give to the miller.
This achieved, they continued with their journey and, to his joy,
Paulina Maria leant conspiratorially towards Johan. This was for nothing
more romantic than to quietly explain that she wished to discourage
Miller Prins from presenting the child at the house since he was
unlikely to resist using the occasion as an excuse to petition her
mother and herself for money to enlarge the mill's house to accommodate
his growing family. It was the view of her parents that the miller was
lucky to have work and a home so should be grateful not greedy. Lacking
any grounds to contradict her, Johan joined the whispered conspiracy
against the miller as the only way he could see to pursue his courtship.

Their destination was soon in view as the Vlist swung round to pass the
village of Willige Langerak to their right. Leaving the dijk, they
turned down beside the church before taking a narrow lane to their left
and halting the \emph{sjees} before the door of a long, low house. An
elderly man appeared from within, followed by the three Haastrecht
servants, all four lining up to welcome them. Johan hastily stepped down
from the carriage and hastened to assist Paulina Maria ahead of the
waiting staff. Although the \emph{sjees} was extremely well sprung and
deeply upholstered he was relieved to be able to straighten his body and
stretch his long legs. Paulina Maria introduced the old man as Jan de
Gier who acted as caretaker of the \emph{jachthuis} then invited Johan
to enter the house with her. Once inside Paulina Maria disappeared into
a distant room along with her maid and he was shown to his own room
where Jan de Gier's son was on hand to help him to make himself
comfortable and clean after the dusty journey.

\subsection{}

The refreshment provided with lunch was most welcome and Johan partook
of several glasses of an excellent Spätburgunder with which to wash down
a hearty serving of cold meats, cheeses and filled breads from the
buffet awaiting them. He noticed that Paulina only drank seltzer water
but made up for this abstemiousness with a hearty appetite for the food,
especially the sweet dishes which were brought in once they had finished
with the savouries. By the time they had eaten their fill they had been
more than an hour and a half at table, the time being consumed in no
small part by the passage of easy conversation between them.
Nevertheless Johan was starting to feel restless and was pleased to
follow up on a talking point by suggesting a stroll to the nearby
church.

On leaving the \emph{jachthuis} they turned right along the lane for the
short walk to their destination, glad of the shade of the few trees at
the edge of the gardens as the heat of the day reached its mid-afternoon
intensity. The low body of the church was painted white with the
addition of a short, square, tower at its western end built in grey
stone, the whole looking very neat and well-kept. As they approached the
portico over the entrance hall the Pastor, having heard them coming,
appeared round the corner from the graveyard with the intention of
opening the doors for them and assisting them in any further way they
might require. However, Paulina Maria deftly dismissed the man saying
that she was sufficiently familiar with the interior of the church.
Johan was thankful for her tact as he so desperately wanted to have her
completely to himself at last with nothing to distract her from his
attentions.

In the cool of the interior they made a brief tour of inspection of what
little there was to see in this simple place of worship, relaxing some
of their social guardedness in response to the calm atmosphere that
often characterises old churches and is so soothing to the spirit. Johan
chose a bench by the wall and drew Paulina Maria to sit beside him where
they were companionably and contentedly silent for a while. Then Johan
gently took her hand and lifted it briefly to his lips before asking;

"Would you do me the honour of considering becoming my wife?"

He had not exactly planned to propose in this place and at this time,
but it had been on his mind to speak to Paulina Maria as soon as he had
the opportunity. He rather fancied that she might wish to take time to
consider the matter especially as he was starting to realize that there
were differences between them. He worried that she might reject him
since it was becoming obvious that their lives took different paths with
his being so unlike that of her father that she might not be able to
accommodate his ways. Although he badly needed to make certain of her,
he was actually somewhat unnerved by her immediate acceptance of his
offer of marriage. Had she really thought the matter over? Would she
change her mind later and break their engagement on further reflection?

Johan now sought to ease his insecurity by suggesting that their
nuptials should take place as soon as possible, a course of action to
which Paulina Maria instantly agreed. He and his new fiancée sat
together in the old church, talking together in hushed tones as they
planned how to make their important announcement and when the wedding
should take place. Everything went smoothly as Paulina Maria knew
exactly what was needed and soon put her organisational skills to work,
relieving him of much of the detailed decision-making, for which he was
ill-equipped anyway. By the time they left the church Johan knew exactly
what he was to do and when in making the announcement of their
forthcoming marriage to their respective families and friends.

Although the success of his suit brought an immediate feeling of relief
and even satisfaction, he still felt a vague sense of unease. It would
seem that Paulina Maria had already secured the blessing of her family
in anticipation of his proposal yet he wondered why they had not found a
better match for her than his unworthy self. Somehow it had all been too
easy, leaving him with the suspicion that he had overlooked some flaw in
the Bisdom van Vliet's in general or Paulina Maria in particular. Or was
it simply that they had not seen through him despite their worldly
wisdom? A new anxiety began to form in his mind to replace his earlier
fear of rejection. As the couple made the return journey to Haastrecht
by \emph{sjees} the notion slowly crystallised in his kind that Paulina
Maria's family were about to give him a place among them solely by
virtue of their own misguidedness. If they knew him for the undeserving
wretch that he really was then he would not be about to occupy the
exalted position of Paulina Maria's husband. He had secured entry to
their patrician family through marriage but was unworthy of it and now
felt the cold fingers of insecurity again reaching for his heart.

\subsection{}

As the Bisdom van Vliet family gathered before dinner on Friday 6th
August Johan was pleased to announce that he and Paulina Maria were to
be married as soon as everything could be put in place. Her family were
delighted although the women were at first somewhat perturbed that there
was to be no formal period of engagement with all its associated social
and sartorial benefits, not to mention the jewelery. Then Marcellus
voiced the view that the couple were old enough to know their own minds
and any undue delay would serve no useful purpose - a view no doubt
bolstered by the brisk and businesslike approach he and Maria had taken
towards their own wedding. Soon all concerns were put aside and a toast
made to the betrothed pair.

The discussion during the meal concluded with an almost military plan of
action having been drawn up. Throughout that evening and the following
day messengers came and went and the house bustled with constant
activity and buzzed with hasty consultations. Johan found himself swept
along on the tide of activity, collapsing exhausted into his bed that
night with no energy left with which to worry about anything. There
seemed very little that he could actually contribute apart from his
general enthusiasm for all that was going on around him and
participation in any necessary formalities. His only personal task was
to write to his brother with the good news and an invitation for Gillis
and Mary to dine at Haastrecht that Sunday evening. Their hearty
congratulations and acceptance of the dinner invitation came by
immediate return.

In what seemed like no time at all the official procedures began with a
visit to the Raadhuis for the Huwelijksafkondigingen which publicly
proclaimed their wedding in writing. There was some urgency in doing
this as it was required that their should be two weeks for any objectors
to come forward before the actual wedding day itself. The next day they
attended Sunday morning service in the Hervormde Kerk for the
announcement of their wedding to the congregation. The Pastor was a
friend of Marcellus's so had already visited the house and, over
refreshments, a relaxed and happy discussion of the detailed wedding
arrangements had resulted in Johan and Paulina Maria emerging with a
clear idea of what was to happen. Being the Burgermeester, Marcellus
himself had organised the civil marriage ceremony in the Raaadhuis that
would precede the Church wedding, the date set for both ceremonies being
August 20th.

Although Johan was familiar with the exterior of the church, whose brick
tower topped with a three-tiered white belfry dominated the village
skyline, he had never been inside. The family had explained that this
was not the original building as this had been destroyed by fire and
rebuilt twice since its 13th century foundation. The last reconstruction
in the 17th century had left the old choir section outside the walls
which resulted in an unusual T-shaped interior. He had been shown the
base of the choir walls and the grave stones covering its vaults which
were now open to the elements and to public use. Now, as they entered
the church, Marcellus and Paulina Maria took him aside in order to show
him the Bisdom van Vliet family vault. Beneath the looping script and
decorative curlicues carved into the stone covering the vault lay the
remains of Paulina Maria's ancestors. The rather chilling thought that
he could well join them was a rather sobering thought.

As he joined the family in their accustomed pew Johan was acutely aware
that he was the object of barely concealed scrutiny by the church goers
gathered in the rows behind them. His presence at the house on
Hoogstraat could hardly have gone unremarked in such a small and
close-knit community as Haastrecht and the gossip surrounding himself
and Paulina Maria must have been rife. So, when the Pastor made the
announcement that their marriage was to take place in less than two
week's time a breaking wave of whispers and rustling clothing broke
across the congregation. Johan felt their eyes upon him as he turned
towards Paulina Maria and they exchanged smiles. Once the service was
over the Bisdom van Vliet family party were the first to leave the
church but nevertheless found themselves waylaid by well-wishers and the
just plain curious, causing them to be considerably delayed on their
return to the house.

After a hasty lunch everyone but Johan resumed their busy wedding
preparations. Lingering at the table with a much-needed glass of wine to
hand he struggled with a cross-current of emotions. He had been caught
up by the general excitement of the wedding announcement and the press
of people outside the church but now found that the celebratory mood
this had induced in him seemed to be shared neither by his bride-to-be
nor by his hosts who all now adopted a cool, businesslike demeanor. A
sense of not being part of the whole process of organising the marriage
- his marriage - and of being relegated to the side-lines was at odds
with wanting to share his happiness. Soon he took his lifelong recourse
from the feeling of being abandoned and went in search of some
independent activity in which he could bury himself. Since Marcellus had
offered him the use of his library and workroom it was to this secluded
place that Johan retreated with a view to reading the newspapers for the
day.

At first he just skipped through the news without taking much in as he
was not in a settled enough frame of mind to undertake the onerous task
of reading about national and provincial politics. Suddenly his eye was
taken by a small item that immediately captured his full attention since
it concerned a lady with whom he had some acquaintance. Back in 1861 he
had been serving on a ship making passage between Den Haag and
Alexandria in the company of three ladies who, much to the irritation of
the officers and crew, they had been ordered to convey in the best
possible comfort. The youngest, Alexine Tinne, had attained some
notoriety as a pioneering photographer and fearless traveller. She was
also among the wealthiest women in the Netherlands. Accompanied by her
widowed mother, her maternal aunt, their several maids and a vast amount
of luggage, accommodating them had caused serious disruption on board.
Although only a few years his senior and not unpleasing to look on,
Vrouw Tinne did not attract him in the usual way. For one thing, her
mode of dress was nothing short of bizarre and for another she had about
her a steely determination to go her own way in the world which quite
threatened the young officer.

Much had been forgiven her, however, when she began to enlivened dinners
in the officers quarters with her vivid accounts of her experiences
whilst travelling through Egypt, Palestine and Syria as well as of her
time living in Beirut, all of which were regarded as territories too
dangerous for a woman to enter. The officers were all enchanted by her
description of her planned expedition in search of the source of Nile, a
feat attempted by few men let alone by woman, and one which they all
secretly wished they could undertake. Once back in Holland he had
hastened to acquire the maps and charts which would enable him to see
where she was about to venture, spending endless hours trying to work
out her possible routes and imagining the hazards and wonders she would
encounter along the way. Over the next few years he bought every book
and paper published about her expeditions and pieced together a
dismaying tale of abandoned hopes as the river proved unnavigable and
illness struck. Vrouw Tinne's mother, aunt and two of her maids died
during her second attempt to penetrate the heart of Africa and she had
been very ill herself. Privately he considered it a tribute his idea of
feminine correctness that they had continued to keep up their Dutch
standards of toilette and domestic routine in the face of such a hostile
environment.

Now he was disturbed to read that Vrouw Tinne had disappeared during her
latest expedition, along with two Dutch sailors who were part of her
\emph{entourage}. Her caravan had set out some weeks previously with the
intention of crossing the Sahara desert in order to encounter the
nomadic Tuareg tribes. She seemed to have made contact with some tribal
leaders upon arriving safely at Marzuk but since then nothing had been
seen or heard of her. She had failed to make contact with a fellow
explorer in the area who had set up a rumour that fleeing survivors from
her caravan told of an ambush and many deaths. Vrouwe Tinne's safety was
feared for, in short. Johan wanted to see for himself what kind of
geographical location she might be in and the physical challenges she
was facing. He got up and began to look through the cupboards and
bookshelves in the hope of an atlas to help him in his quest.

At the fourth try he opened a cupboard to find the welcome sight of
three rows of the familiar tubes of twenty or so rolled-up maps which
Marcellus had neatly arranged inside. Johan reverently lifted them out
one by one, unrolling each in turn on the top of the large table in the
centre of the room, holding down their four corners with convenient
small, heavy objects. Thus he took stock of the treasure he had found,
carefully rolling each map up and replacing it in the cupboard as he
finished with it. There was, of course, nothing on Africa but instead a
wealth of material relating to Holland in general and to the
Krimpenerwaard in particular, some of it familiar from his own
collection and even some of the work of his grandfather. Several river
charts took his interest as either very old or for their obvious use as
working documents which had been annotated in the process of taking
water management decisions. After some deliberation, he chose one from
among them for closer scrutiny.

He reverently laid out what he recognised as a hand-coloured print on
paper made from a copper engraving of the original chart as drawn by
Melchior Bolstra in the middle of the last century. He knew that it was
one of a set of seven sheets which covered the whole of the River Lek,
part of a mapping exercise which covered all the rivers of Holland. This
particular sheet showed the reach of the river that passed Willige
Langerak, a village which now held sentimental interest for him. Only
forty or so copies of Bolstra's maps had been produced, their ownership
restricted to officials of the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland and the
local river and polder boards. None had been allowed into general
circulation and many were now lost from sight. Marcellus's forbears had
clearly been involved in the making of important decisions about the
management of the Lek which were to prove successful in preventing the
repeated flooding that had occurred since the Spyk dyke breach in 1740.
The map had also been used in their deliberations about work on the bed
of the river which would ensure that it remained an efficient navigation
route for shipping.

Bolstra had undertaken a meticulous survey of the Lek between 1750 and
1754, following the principles introduced by Cruquius which combined
rigorously gathered quantitative data with the usual cartographic
drawing. Unlike Croquius, Bolstra did not keep his data in separate
tables but integrated it into the chart itself to produce an accurate
representation of the river bed and the other topographical elements of
the fluvial environment. Johan knew that, although Bolstra had amassed
data concerning the depth of the river and the shape of the river bed,
he was yet to develop the system of contour lines. He was also aware
that the results of Bolstra's research into river flow were never
applied to the chart, although they had been available in manuscript
form. Rather less of a shortcoming in Johan's view was the lack of
detail included about the land beyond the river and its banks and dykes,
a focus on navigation by water which showed the map-maker to be of like
minds with himself.

After some moments in silent appreciation of the history of the chart
before him, Johan delved into the breast pocket of his coat and removed
a square pouch made of soft leather from which he carefully slid his
folding brass magnifying glass. He opened the glass out so that it
rested on its frame with the lens at just the right height to bring the
details of the chart into focus. Now he bent to the happy task of
reading the old chart before him, as others might read a sheet of music
or a good book. In his blood ran the gift of visualising mere lines on
paper as the very thing that they had been made to represent. So, the
territory mapped rose in his minds eye as a three-dimensional landscape,
coloured and in motion as nature and man had made it. Not only that but
he could move about in this inner world: altering course here and
altitude there, compensating for wind and current, avoiding the
precipice and finding the track most economical of effort. Then, at
will, his perspective would shift back to the drawing before him and a
course to run would appear to him as clearly as if the line to follow
had already been drawn upon the paper.

Now he saw, as if he were there, the river gently curving to port before
him as it flowed towards the sea, the low water lazy at the turn of a
neap tide and depleted by the summer sun. To starboard he perceived the
pattern of ditches, walls and triangular bastions that made up the
six-pointed defensive star that protected Nieuwpoort against artillery
attack. Ahead and to port rose Schoonhoven's larger, eight-pointed
\emph{trace italienne} fortifications beyond which the river made a turn
to starboard before evaporating at the western edge of the chart. He
could see that, as well as protecting against attack by man, these
ramparts would save both cities from floods, the harbours and shipyards
tucked behind them providing refuge for shipping.

Having looked around him in a general way, Johan now turned his
attention to the north bank just before Schoonehoven where the village
of Willege Langerak lay tucked behind a shallow dyke. He passed across
the shallows at the edge of the river and floated up and over the dyke
to the gratifying sight of the church with its tower ahead of him
looking almost exactly as it had a century later on. The gentlest of
smiles warmed his face at the recollection of the day that he had spoken
to Paulina Maria within with such a happy outcome. Turning to look at
what was now the \emph{jachthuis} he found instead two ramshackle
cottages and was reminded of the Bisdom van Vliet's wealth which had
enabled these mean dwellings to be transformed into the well-appointed
hunting lodge and stables that he had visited.

Having made his sentimental journey to Willige Langerak he floated over
fields and dykes to Schoonhoven itself where he became engrossed in
exploring the harbour and waterways that were so much a part of the old
city, losing himself in how life was before the steam engine and the
river improvements. The weight of a hand on his shoulder roused Johan to
the present and to Paulina Maria beside him.

"We thought we had lost you, nobody has seen you for hours! I'm glad
that we could provide you with something to occupy you and only sorry to
have to disturb you, but it is time to dress for dinner. Your brother
and our other guests are expected shortly."

Johan took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and looked in disbelief
at the time.

"Thank you for coming to find me, my dear. I shall just replace this
chart then go to make myself ready for our celebration dinner."

He took Paulina Maria's hand and raised it to his lips, causing her a
slight giggle at the tickle of his moustaches, then turned to roll up
Bolstra's chart. Paulina Maria filled with a warm glow as she took in
the curve of his strong back bent over the table. Next he went about the
business of placing the chart among its fellows in their cupboard. She
could barely resist reaching out to touch his beautiful dark hair. Order
restored to the maps, he turned towards her and they fell into an
unpremeditated mutual embrace, heedless of the possibility of being
observed.

Paulina Maria was wearing her new Bride Dress for the first time that
evening. As Johan returned to her side, dressed for dinner and ready to
receive the congratulations of their guests, he complimented her on it
fulsomely, although privately he wondered at her choice of such a bold
hue which was a surprisingly fashionable choice for her. Although her
complexion could stand up to the colour, the gown itself was so busy
with every form of adornment that it quite swamped even Paulina Maria's
robust frame and owed its design to no form of fashion that he knew of.
He suspected Paulina Maria's own whims had steered its creation and
quailed somewhat at the thought that she would be wearing this same
garment to all their engagements between now and the end of the
honeymoon, and that it would live on in perpetuity in their wedding
photographs. He would now have to reconsider wearing his full dress
uniform for their big day as Paulina Maria's gown would undoubtedly
distract everyone's attention from it.

As the guests for their dinner party began to arrive and assemble in the
Grote Salon Johan was introduced to Marcellus' brother, Otto Braet
Bisdom van Cattenbroek, and his wife, Adelaide. Paulina Maria's uncle,
who was called Braet by everyone, seemed a rather dull old chap compared
to the cheery and sociable Marcellus. Despite being Marcellus's younger
brother by four years Braet's hair was quite grey. His heavy eyelids
drooped as though weary of looking at the world and his mouth came to
rest with its corners turned down in lamentation of his lot in life.
From the conversation amongst the Bisdom family Johan gathered that
Uncle Braet was an Advocate of some importance in the city of Utrecht
and had taken the van Cattenbroek name from his lands a few miles
upstream along the Hollandse Ijssel near the city of Montfoort. It
seemed to Johan that Uncle Braet had got himself out from under the
shadow of his prominent sibling by removing himself from South Holland
to Utrecht and its Province, altering his name to simply Braet van
Cattenbroek and seeking prominence in a different public sphere.

By contrast, Vrouw van Cattenbroek appeared to be much younger being
possessed of an open, round face which displayed few signs of a
care-worn personality. Her buxom figure and straight brown hair were
simply dressed giving an air of motherliness about her. Just as Gillis
and Mary had named their first-born Johan Jacob after him so Braet and
Adelaide had named their firstborn after Paulina Maria. This youngest
Paulina Maria was now in her twenty-first year so it seemed a shame that
she had not been invited that evening. He lost count of their other
children who were mostly girls with the only boy he registered being
ten-year-old 'Freddie'. He found all the talk around him was of children
which was rather tedious and he idly wondered if his view of them would
change when his own arrived on the scene. For now, though, he was
reduced to making polite noises as his mind attempted to desert to more
interesting matters. He had even more of a struggle to keep up
appearances when the women of the party began to make admiring comments
about Paulina's Bride Dress and invited him to agree with them. He was
never so grateful as when the butler announced that dinner was to be
served.

A few glasses of wine and he began to feel more relaxed, although he
felt he could contribute little of substance to the dinner table talk.
Everyone wanted to know the details of the wedding, the wedding party,
the honeymoon and where they planned to establish their home. On most
topics he was as uninformed as all the other guests and learned a lot
from the Paulina Maria's account of what was planned. It appeared was
his task to arrange the honeymoon but it had come as quite a shock to
him that he was expected to have this well in hand already when, in
fact, he had given it no thought until now. He tried to hide behind a
wish to keep it a secret from Paulina Maria but nobody believed that
such a thing was possible so he was forced to make a plan on the spur of
the moment. He remembered Paulina Maria showing him her albums from the
coach trip she had made through the Alps to Italy and how
enthusiastically she talked of the water, flora and fauna she had seen
along the way. Inspired by the notion of water, he broadly hinted that
they would be visiting the Mediterranean in the South of France before
passing through to the lakes of Italy and Switzerland. To his great
relief this suggestion clearly pleased and excited Paulina Maria so met
with general approval. He only hoped that he would be able to make good
on what was now taken to be his promise.

Paulina Maria and Marcellus were had already compiled a list of guests
for the wedding party to which Gillis and Johan had contributed as many
of names of family, friends and professional that they could think of.
The Tivoli in Utrecht, owned by another of Marcellus's friends, had been
chosen as the most suitable venue for this prestigious event. The city
had good water, rail and road links across the Netherlands, Germany and
Belgium with plenty of respectable accommodation to be had. The Tivoli
consisted of an attractive park within which a grand hall had recently
been built as an improved venue for the concerts that the gardens were
known for. The replacement of the old wooden concert hall with a larger,
stone-faced building now meant that this Grote Zaal had attained a
reputation for hosting grand events, such as the 50th anniversary
masquerade of the Utrecht university in 1868. Thus it was considered by
the family to have the right pedigree for such a significant occasion as
the marriage of Marcellus and Maria Bisdom van Vliet's only daughter
which needed to be socially conspicuous.

A scheduling problem had then arisen because the guest list was so long
that it would require two separate sittings in order to accommodate
everyone. Paulina Maria had therefore decided that two identical wedding
parties would be held on consecutive days but this was not easy to
arrange as the hall had other bookings and the caterers needed time to
prepare. In the end she arranged that the wedding parties should take
place on the Monday and Tuesday preceding the formal ceremonies
scheduled for Friday the twentieth. She anticipated that they would
depart for their honeymoon on Saturday the twenty-first, an idea which
Johan did not disabuse her of. Once again, Johan was impressed be her
ability to organise matters, especially as she already had preparations
well in hand for the dual parties which were now only just over week
away. Uncle Braet roused himself to give his blessing to the choice of
the Tivoli venue and to offer the family accommodation for the duration
of their stay in Utrecht as well as volunteering his wife's local
knowledge of the best catering suppliers.

By the end of the meal Johan's head was swimming with information, as
well as the various wines and spirits which he had sampled. It was no
wonder that the house had been such a hive of activity since he and
Paulina Maria had made their announcement. He could now see why Paulina
Maria had made no time for him and could appreciate what a remarkable
amount she had achieved in only a short time. He was now to return to
Den Haag with Gillis and Mary and he was glad of some quiet time alone
with his own people, finding it was relaxing to be able to be calm with
them as a respite from the whirlwind of the dinner party. They were
concerned that matters were moving too fast for him, despite wishing to
see the match settled in short order. Johan confessed that his head was
spinning at the scale and speed of what felt like a military operation
set in train to the end of a rather more splendid wedding than he could
ever have envisaged, but he did not want to change anything. He could
adjust to the situation and was already starting to think about how he
could play his own, distinctive part in it all.

\section{Overig August 1869}

\subsection{}

The man considered it a sound investment to spend a few days working at
a menial task for poor payment whilst enduring the bullying tirades of
the nasty little chap who considered himself to be his superior. He
laboured away fetching and carrying everything from heavy tables to the
starched white cloths that would cover them, from boxes of silver
cutlery to delicate floral arrangements, from crates of Champagne to
trays of the fragile glasses from which it would be drunk. Then the pace
changed as the tables were dressed and the places set with a military
regularity that was checked with a measuring stick to ensure perfect
spacings and alignments. Once the Tivoli's \emph{grote zaal} had been
laid out to the exacting standards of the overseer, the hired help were
given time to rest and eat a basic meal of bread and cheese washed down
with water or milk that was not provided out of any concern for the
workers' welfare but from the necessity of discouraging them from
helping themselves from the food and drink intended for the banquet.

After being sent away to clean themselves up and put on the uniforms
that would transform them from workmen into stewards, their next task
was to greet the guests, surreptitiously checking that they were
\emph{bona fide} before showing them to their proper places. Two long
tables ran the length of the \emph{grote zaal} from the slightly raised
top table which stretched across the head of the room. In the centre of
the top table and right opposite the main doors so that it was the first
thing the guests would see as they entered the \emph{room} was the grand
'throne' upon which the bride and groom would sit beneath its fragrant
canopy of pine branches which symbolised the evergreen nature the
marital bond. Someone had put considerable diplomatic effort into the
seating plan for the two long tables, making sure that the most
important guests were seated in their proper order of importance whilst
avoiding \emph{cliques} or uncomfortable clashes of interests or
personalities. So, it had been impressed upon the stewards that no
changes of place whatsoever were to occur, either by accident or design.

Although there was still an hour or more to go before the event was due
to start, well-dressed men and women were already arriving and milling
about the gardens. Whilst his colleagues were content to wait at the
doors to the \emph{grote zaal} for guests to approach them, the man set
about unobtrusively identifying the wanderers and the new arrivals,
shepherding them towards the stewards at the doors without them noticing
either him or his influence upon them. His invisibility enabled him to
overhear snippets of unguarded conversation, making good use of his
knowledge of languages other than Dutch, and observe subtleties of
behaviour. He noticed who bribed his colleagues in order to be seated
nearer to whom, or further away from whom. This was why he was here, to
gather information that would no doubt be of use to him in his usual,
more lucrative, occupation. To this end he used his keen awareness of
what was going on around him to avoid being co-opted to help with
managing the press of carriages clogging the drive or carrying in the
food which was being delivered to the back door.

As the last guests took their seats in good time for the arrival of the
bride and her wedding party, the man insinuated himself into a position
where he would naturally be attending to the most important guests who
were placed near to the top table. At 17.00 hours exactly, Paulina Maria
Bisdom van Vliet swept into the room and took her place on the 'throne'
in the centre of the top table. The familiar figures of her father and
uncle, brother-in-law Viruly and Gilles le Fevre de Montigny, all
accompanied by their wives, followed her along with her soon-to-be
husband, about whom the man knew more than he had ever told. The women
of the party seated themselves amid much arranging of skirts whilst the
men had only to worry about their coat tails. The bride was joined on
the 'throne' by Johan Jacob le Fevre de Montigny seated to her left
whilst her father was on her right flank. Once the top table had settled
themselves and an expectant hush had descended upon the assembled body
the Master of Ceremonies stepped forward and set the nuptial
celebrations in motion with the traditional welcome:

\emph{Blijde feestdag, blijde feestdag, blijde feestdag}

\emph{Wij juighen u tegen}

\emph{Gij bragt aan de burger een zeer grote zegen}

\emph{De velden doorklonk het uit iederen mond}

\emph{Blijde feestdag, blijde feestdag}

\emph{Ter eere van Bruid en Bruidegom}

\emph{Een hartelijk welkom}

Happy holiday, happy holiday, happy holiday

We cheer you

You brought to the citizen a very large blessing

It rings through the fields from every mouth

Happy holiday, happy holiday

For the honour of bride and groom

A warm welcome

A huge cheer rang out from the guests who clapped the couple with
enthusiasm, although many of them had never before set eyes on either of
them. The man thought that they were really celebrating the signal to
begin eating and drinking as much as they liked at someone else's
expense, as well as capitalising on the opportunity to further their
political, business and amorous interests. He himself was not
particularly interested in the food on offer, although one of the other
stewards had gossiped that he had counted forty-seven different savoury
dishes, gleefully listing pike, perch, chicken, suckling pig, snipe,
hare, partridge, pigeon, lamb stuffed with cauliflower, \emph{petit
pois}, beans and endives before either his memory or his imagination ran
out. This was to be followed by seventeen deserts, apparently, but the
man had lost patience with the fellow's account of these after the
fourth type of tart had been described. What he was here for was what he
would observe and overhear as he cleared away the empty plates and
glasses.

As if all the food and drink were not enough to keep the diners
occupied, the meal was frequently punctuated by speeches from friends
and family who told the life story of the bride and the groom, or a
version of it, as well as offering anecdotes which illustrated the
admirable qualities of each. On a livelier note, the company were
invited to join in several songs of a whimsical nature relating to magic
mops and such like. One alleged that the Zweeuwse farmers were amazed at
the agility and genius of the bride and groom, which the man thought
could be taken in several ways. These interludes resulted in the
majority of the guests returning to their seats providing a respite from
the general milling about which made the man's job more complicated.

As well as for the usual calls of nature, guests who were not making
speeches also got up to deliver presents to the bride and groom which
she unwrapped there and then before handing them over to her intended so
that they could both admire them before passing them around for the
approval of everyone else. As was her nature, she kept a meticulous list
of who had given them what so that the right gift might be brought out
on show during future visits of the giver. All of this rigmarole took an
inordinate amount of time and entailed a lot of wandering about, which
made it difficult for the man to keep track of those people he had
identified as of special interest to him. But, he also picked up some
unexpected pieces of intelligence from others as they crossed his path.

The light had already faded from the summer sky by the time the
gathering partook of the last few items on the carefully orchestrated
programme. Three large silver bowls full of brandy and raisins, one for
each table, began their progress from person to person whilst the
assembly energetically sang the song;

\emph{Hoe zoet is het daar de vriendschap woont}

\emph{}

How sweet it is where friendship dwells

Some of the stewards took up baskets laden with small gifts of the
sweets and wine which they offered to each guest. The \emph{Bruid
suikas}, little packages of five sweets wrapped in tulle, symbolized the
wedding wishes of love, happiness, loyalty, prosperity, and virility
causing several of the recipients to make wry comments upon the latter.
The \emph{Bruidstranen}, small bottles of spiced wine containing a
little gold leaf to represent the bride's tears, further provoked
innuendos. The Master of Ceremonies made his closing declarations,
thanked the assembled party for the Paulina and Johan's nuptial
celebrations then bade everyone farewell on behalf of the bride and
groom. The bride and groom rose from their throne to lead the platform
party out of the \emph{grote zaal} to a final round of cheers and
applause.

In the body of the hall chairs scraped back, clothing rustled and the
hubbub of conversation resumed as people headed for the doors and their
waiting transport beyond. This was the last chance for the man to pick
up morsels of information for the already brimming storehouse in his
brain before he and the other stewards had to set about the task of
clearing away and setting the room straight. There was a lull as the men
changed pace again from the public performance of stewarding to the more
relaxed nature of backstage domestics. Taking advantage of this social
space, the man quickly and quietly made his way round the tables
pocketing those lost, forgotten or abandoned personal items that might
later be of use to him in his work.

Once the clatter of work resumed, the man joined in the camaraderie
which so often spontaneously develops between those who serve as they
wind down from of important events like this. They, too had heard things
and were as keen to gossip to their fellows as he was to listen and
encourage. Even the overseer was in better spirits now that the day had
passed off successfully, no doubt helped by his having surreptitiously
rewarded himself with the dregs of the bottles as they were taken out
for collection. On the orders of the bride, any left-over food had been
taken for distribution to the poor but she had forbidden them any
alcohol and the overseer believed that it would have been a shame to
waste it. The men were instructed to take off their white aprons and
shirts so that the laundry baskets, into which the table cloths and
napkins had already been thrown, could be taken away for laundering
overnight. They were to hang up the rest of their uniforms and change
back into their own working clothes for the last cleaning up before they
straggled out into the night to make their weary way home.

The man was careful to avoid company as he made his way along
Kruisstraat in the direction of the his hotel which he had carefully
chosen to afford anonymity by being the largest in Utrecht. As he walked
along he adjusted his clothing to give a smarter appearance, altering
his bearing and gait to such good effect that a gentleman returning from
a late night stroll collected his room key and messages from the night
porter. He ordered a good supper to be brought to his room, being now
very hungry as well as wishing to sustain himself for the work of the
day yet to be done. A ewer of hot water was waiting for him by the time
he opened his door so he was able to wash and change into his nightshirt
and dressing gown whilst waiting for his supper tray. The servant
bringing his food stayed briefly to hang up his clothes and remove the
empty water jug before being assured that he would not be wanted again
that night.

Having made himself comfortable and secured the privacy of his chamber,
the man set about organising the material he had gathered at the
banquet. First he retrieved from his mental filing system all that he
already knew about the persons of interest whom he had encountered that
day. Then he put pen to paper making additional notes about each one as
well as adding some new individuals to his bank of knowledge. One by one
he dealt with the people he was watching, committing the contents of
each sheet of notes to his phenomenal memory store. Once all had been
attended to, the man bent over the grate and dismantled the fire which
had been laid there against a sudden drop in temperature or bout of
illness. He carefully twisted and knotted his now discarded papers into
bows and placed them amongst those which had already formed the basis of
the unlit fire. He replaced the sticks of kindling and the coals, from
small to large. Taking a taper from the jar on the grate he lit it from
one of the lamps and applied it to the foundations of the fire, pleased
to see the flames immediately take hold creating a sudden and intense
conflagration which destroyed all it could find to feed on.

Only now could the man allow himself the luxury of a glass of brandy and
a cigar sitting in a chair beside the roaring fire. It did not take long
for him to relax into a state where he was able to get into bed, falling
asleep to the first bird calls of a new day. It was only a few hours
until he was woken by the arrival of his morning shaving water but he
felt refreshed and alert, ready for another working day. Although his
duties at Tivoli would begin later today, no furniture needing to be
moved until the second day of banqueting was over, the man began his
observations at breakfast in the hotel. Here he could keep his eyes on
the numerous other guests, some due to depart after the previous day's
celebrations and some preparing for those to come that day, all of whom
seemed to share the feeling that they could not refuse their invitation
as it was hard to plead prior engagements for both days. Only Hendrick
Prins der Nederlanden en Prins van Oranje-Nassau could decline to attend
without any embarrassment to anyone. Henrik \emph{de Zeevaarder}, as he
was known, was a naval man and a navigator like the groom with whom he
frequently socialised in the manner of sailors on shore leave. The man
had been very careful not to disclose what he knew of the activities of
these men when making his report to Theodorus Viruly concerning the
groom's suitability as a husband for the Bisdom van Vleit daughter.

Having lingered over breakfast, the man made a thorough check to make
sure that all was in order in his room then paid his bill and left
instructions for his luggage to be packed and conveyed to the station
left luggage office. It was time to set out for his second day at the
Tivoli, reversing the transformation from gentleman to working man of
the previous night as he strode along. Although the programme was
exactly the same as that of the previous day down to the last detail the
different mix of guests made for a quite distinct experience. The man
followed the same strategy as previously but found his task was
complicated by the disruptive boisterousness of the groom's naval
shipmates and the presence of several important political figures who
had seen him before but in a different guise. To his relief and
satisfaction, he did not appear to have been recognised but nevertheless
took pains to keep at a distance from those who might be able to
identify him. On the other hand, the to-ing and fro-ing of the
seafarers, who refused to stay in their alloted seats and demanded a
great deal of attention from the stewards, added to the already raised
levels of activity with the effect that they somewhat hampered the man's
ability find an unobtrusive place from which to watch and listen.

By the time the guests had left and the clearing up began patience was
getting stretched among the servants making everyone irritable. Tonight
they had the added labour of clearing the furniture from the
\emph{grote} \emph{zaal}, heavy work for the tired men whose minds were
already elsewhere with wives and sweethearts, food and drink. At last
the overseer was satisfied that the room was being left as it had been
found and called the staff to line up to receive their payment before
dismissing them to go their separate ways into the night. The man had a
few hours to kill before catching the early train to Den Haag so took a
circuitous route to the station, ruefully turning over the few coins in
his pocket that had been his payment at the end of the two days. By the
time he had bought himself an early breakfast at the bargee's favourite
eetcafe on the Oude Gracht and tipped the station porter who dealt with
his luggage there was not much left. His work was not yet done, either,
as he still had his records to get up to date once he arrived back at
his own, solitary dwelling.

\subsection{}

If Paulina had harboured any concerns about being left at the alter they
were soon dispelled. The whole village could hear the groom's procession
as it came along the dyke top from Gouda since it was headed up by the
band of the field artillery regiment playing for all they were worth.
The groom's carriage was escorted by a huge troop, later reported in the
Schoonhovensche en Haastrechtsche Courant to have numbered 90, of young
men dressed in uniforms to match that of the groom. All of his guests
followed in a long train of horse-drawn conveyances which added to their
clatter and chatter to the din. As the whole noisy entourage arrived at
the edge of the village another guard of honour joined them and escorted
the groom, now on foot, in a swaggering and jubilant procession to the
Bisdom van Vliet house.

The Haastrecht villagers had not been unsparing in their preparations
for Paulina's marriage either. The front door of the house had been
painted green, as was the tradition, and a triumphal arch erected in
front of it for the bride to pass under. The children from the village
school had greatly enjoyed decorating this arch and joining in with the
making of green flags which were then strung between all the houses in
Haastrecht and along the fronts of the farms in Stein and Vlist.
Flowers, and various insignia completed the festoons and even the
competing religious denominations had come together to raise money in
order to make a display of their various arms and symbols.

The correspondent for the Schoonhovensche en Haastrechtsche Courant was
so overwhelmed by all these wedding preparations that he was reduced to
somewhat heatedly reporting;

... \emph{het strekke alleen ten bewijze dat daar, waar eensgezindheid
en erkentijkheid op de voorgrond staan, welwillendheid en liefde niet
achterblijven.}

\emph{}

... this demonstrates that, where harmony and gratitude are to the fore,
benevolence and love are not far behind.

The groom's cavalcade halted when it came to the Bisdom van Vliet house
and here they re-arranged themselves for the next stage in their
progress. The chamber in the Raadhuis where the formal marriage ceremony
was to take place was too small to accommodate more than a modest
wedding party restricted to the couple's most intimate family and
friends. All the other guests would be provided with light refreshments
at the house before moving on to the church. Those members of the
groom's band, escort and honour guard who were not required for the next
stage of the procession were allowed to relax in the \emph{overtuin}
where they were given some rather more modest food and drink than that
on offer indoors. It took a while for the clamour of the groom's arrival
to die down during which time Paulina waited patiently in her room until
the moment arrived when she could be sure of being the centre of
attention as she processed through the village to begin her nuptials.
Those who were to accompany her to the Raadhuis gathered in the
vestibule, the groom's excess of high spirits gradually being calmed by
his brother.

Once the Raadhuis cortege, with a somewhat reduced number of musicians
and guard of honour, had formed up Marcellus went to fetch his daughter.
They were both rather disconcerted by Johan Jacob's grandiose and
flamboyant arrival which threatened to upstage their preparations and to
eclipse the augustness of the marriage rite itself. Marcellus was aware
that Viruly still had doubts about the suitability of the bridegroom and
for the first time he began to have misgivings himself. Paulina sensed a
reserve in her father's behaviour which made for an awkwardness between
them quite uncharacteristic of their relationship. She had felt a little
on edge already but attributed this to the gravity of the occasion. On
top of this, the delay caused by Johan Jacob's unanticipated departure
from her carefully arranged schedule had perturbed her. So, she
attributed the strangeness between herself and her father to bridal
nerves which caused her to anxiously avert her gaze from him thereby
effectively blocking any further communication between them. The
distance between them meant that Marcellus felt unable to gently remind
his only child that it was not too late to call the wedding off, so he
followed her down to the vestibule in silence instead.

Once they reached the crowded vestibule both father and daughter found
themselves caught up by the expectations of the assemblage which
involuntarily propelled them into the day their, minds empty of all
doubt or apprehension. They did, however, depart from protocol in just
one way when, as a result of some tacit agreement between them, Paulina
took her father's arm and not that of her bridegroom before stepping out
through the green door, walking under the triumphal arch and out onto
the petal-strewn street to take her place at the head of the wedding
procession. The groom had been so caught up in putting on his own show
for his admirers that he let the moment pass when he might have
intervened and claimed his bride for his own arm. It took some
management by his brother to focus his attention and prevail upon him to
fall in behind his bride and her father ahead of the other members of
their families and the chosen friends.

The Hoogstrat was lined with cheering adults and children who had come
out in their numbers to scatter petals under the bride's feet and wish
the her well. Paulina and Marcellus walked slowly so as to acknowledge
the crowd's good wishes and show their appreciation and admiration for
the bedecked streets. At last they arrived at the bottom of the stone
steps leading up to the marriage room within the Raadhuis. The pretty
little step-gabled town hall was so old that it even pre-dated the
arrival of Adriaan Bisdom in Haastrecht. At one point its steps decayed
to become so unsafe that old Oma's husband, burgemeester Salomon
Reynders Bisdom van Vliet, had ordered them demolished and replaced by
the handsome hard stone steps which now rose to the door into De
Burgerzaal where all the marriages were solemnized including those of
Paulina's ancestors. It was only when they reached the bottom of the
steps that Paulina's father looked round for Johan Jacob, signaling that
the groom should now step up beside the bride to accept the greetings
and thanks of the guests as they made their way into the wedding room.

When everyone in the intimate circle had disappeared into the Raadhuis,
Paulina made her way up the seven steps supporting herself by holding
onto the iron hand rail with one had and her groom with the other.
Perhaps it was that his feet were obscured by her huge skirts but
Paulina did not feel that Johan Jacob was entirely confident on his feet
and was glad when they reached the level platform between the steps and
the doorway. A lion statue stood at either end of this balcony, one
holding the coat of arms of Haastrecht and the other holding the arms of
South Holland. Since she had been a child visiting her father in his
burgermeesterskamer Paulina had been in the habit of touching the top of
each lion's head for good luck and she did not intend to tempt fate by
breaking this pattern today. As she reached for the first lion she
inadvertently jostled Johan Jacob causing him to totter back down the
top step, confirming her feeling that he had not quite lost his sea
legs. Once the second lion had had his head tapped Paulina made her
grand entry into the Raadhuis with the now recovered Johan Jacob in her
wake.

Marcellus's deputy was to perform the ceremony and was there inside the
door to greet the bride and groom, ushering them to their places before
the table which held the large book in which their marriage was to be
recorded. As Johan Jacob removed his ceremonial sword and handed it to
his brother before being seated, Paulina took her first proper look at
her bridegroom. He was resplendent in a uniform decorated with shiny
buttons, badges and shoulder boards as well as the belt which had held
his sword and scabbard. Her heart leapt at the sight of him, restoring
to the full her confidence in the marriage she was about to contract.
But first they had to wait for the company to settle down. The room was
full to capacity as the importance of the Bisdom van Vliet's dictated
that the maximum possible number of guests be accommodated. The generous
proportions of the floral arrangements placed on the floor at the end of
each row of seats combined with the copious skirts of the ladies to fill
every available niche so that it seemed as though the smiling faces of
the guests were floating above a billowing sea of shimmering fabrics and
colourful blooms. It was also quite dim and hot in the chamber as the
door and lower window shutters had been closed for privacy allowing
little light or air to wash over what remained of the unoccupied space
in the room.

Paulina was, therefore, glad that the formalities were quickly under way
and conducted at a brisk pace. After a brief speech of welcome, the
Loco-burgemeester asked the couple to stand and face each other,
clasping their right hands. First his marriage vow was read to Johan
Jacob to which he assented in a clear, firm voice. Then Paulina Maria
heard her vows and also gave her assent without hesitation. A murmur of
delight ran round the room. In his role as Ambtenaar van de Burgerlijke
Stand, Marcellus's deputy managed to balance due gravitas with a
lightness of touch that left the gathering in a suitably celebratory
mood when he seized the right moment to pronounce Paulina and Jacob
wedded in the eyes of the law. Johan kissed his bride to a round of
applause from the gathering before the couple took their seats again for
the final formality of signing the register.

Man and wife now led the way back through the cheering villagers lining
Hoogstraat, taking the turning down to the church instead of continuing
to the house.. They passed beneath another triumphal arch and were
scattered with more petals as they stood to one side and accepted the
congratulations of the last members of the congregation as they filed
past them into the church. Once everyone was seated inside, the Pastor
led the couple to their seats beside him at the front of the knave. The
interior of the plain white church was decorated with floral displays of
an even more striking size and vibrancy than those in the Raadhuis and
swags of pure white tulle decorated the ends of all the pews.

Paulina was thankful that there was more space, light and air inside the
church as she knew that the consecration of her marriage before God was
going to be a more lengthy affair than the civil ceremony had been. She
was glad of the presence of her parents seated nearby in the front row
of pews, surprising herself at how much she drew support just from
seeing them there. She was feeling more emotional than she would ever
have thought she could be and, although she considered herself to be a
devout woman who was a regular worshiper at the church, Paulina found
the length of the wedding service tested her capacity for stoicism
almost to its limit. With great self-discipline she sat through many
readings from the Bible, a lengthy homily from the Pastor and more
speeches by close family and friends. It was something of a relief when
this seemingly endless stream of well-intentioned words was punctuated
by music and, better yet, standing to sing a hymn.

Then Paulina and Johan were stirred to action as they were called to
stand before the Pastor and take turns in repeating their vows before
God, now more fully and explicitly stating the duties and
responsibilities of marriage which they were accepting. A gold ring
resting on a plush velvet cushion was brought before the Pastor who
blessed it and reminded the couple that it was a symbol of the eternity
of the marriage bond which was to be placed on the right hand as this
was the good, not sinister, hand and so connected to the divine. Johan
picked up the ring then gently took Paulina's right hand in his left and
slipped the ring onto her third finger. She felt a lump rise in her
throat and tears well up in her eyes, indeed she trembled with a
suppressed sob. In response to this Johan gave her hand a gentle squeeze
and, when she turned to look at him, she found that he, too, had moist
eyes.

Another red velvet cushion was brought to the Pastor, this one
supporting the wedding bible in the front of which their marriage was
already inscribed and where they would go on to add the names and dates
of birth of their children along with other significant events, not all
of which would be so joyous. The bible was given into Johan's keeping
with the direction that the couple should keep it as the family bible
for the new le Fevre de Montingy - Bisdom van Vliet line. Paulina felt a
flush of pride when she heard her family name so openly and directly
linked with that of her husband as founders of a new branch of the
family. It mattered very much to her that she should produce an heir to
the wealth and position of her family. But there was a deeper need
arriving within her that suddenly demanded her attention - she wanted to
have children, soon and lots of them. She was abashed at this very
public allusion to such intimate matters, not fully realising that her
private thoughts remained hidden from scrutiny and not as conspicuous to
the congregation looking on as she feared. Rather self-consciously, she
risked a sidelong glance at Johan and found him looking intently at the
bible in his hands with a sheepish expression on his face which somewhat
puzzled her.

Then suddenly it was over and Paulina felt thoroughly and very publicly
married. As she and Johan turned to face the body of the church in
preparation for making their exit, Paulina half hoped that he would be
romantic enough to kiss her again in front of everybody whilst admitting
to herself that this would actually embarrass her. She did not quite
know if she was glad or not that no kiss was forthcoming, instead he
took her hand and placed it through his arm for the procession out of
the church where, reunited with his sword, he would escort her back to
the family's house. Once more they made their way haltingly as they
accepted the congratulations of the onlookers, smiling until their faces
felt as if they might never go back straight again. When they had
attained the sanctuary of the house they were tactfully granted some
time to themselves in a small ante-room on the ground floor the old
\emph{familiehuis}. Now they held each other and exchanged kisses with
the freedom that being married now allowed them as well as the
awkwardness of novelty.

\subsection{}

The rest of her wedding day did not pass off with quite the finesse that
Paulina could have wished for. It had sounded eminently sensible when
Johan had explained to her that, by the time they might reasonable
expect to be able to take their leave from Haastrecht, it would be too
late in the day for an immediate departure for Germany and the start of
their honeymoon trip, yet she could not hide from herself that she was a
little disappointed. This sense of blighted hopes deepened into
disgruntlement when he told her that they would be spending their first
night of marriage in his rooms at the Hotel De Zalm. Perhaps familiarity
should not breed contempt but nevertheless she felt somewhat irked that
commonplace old Gouda and Johan's habitual residence were to be the
setting for the consummation that would mark the final covenant of their
marriage. If the arrangements had been left to her then a more exclusive
and original venue would have been found, one which held no resonances
with their separate pasts. On the other hand, Gouda did have the cachet
of being the place where they met.

To convey them to the hotel Johan had ordered an appropriately luxurious
landau which was pulled by a pair of fine white horses and decorated
with flowers and ribbons. When the time came for them to set out for
their new life together their closest family gathered in the
\emph{familiehuis} vestibule for the final farewells. Paulina found it
hard to tear herself away from her papa's embrace but saw that her mama
was waiting for her turn to tearfully hug and kiss her youngest daughter
as she left the shelter of her family to embark on the joys and sorrows
of the wedded state. After discreetly allowing the Bisdom van Vliets a
few moments of farewell Johan stepped forward to claim his bride,
leaving her mother and father to cling to each other in their happiness
and grief.

A liveried coachman assisted the couple into the landau to take the
seats which faced forwards whilst a boy groom held the horses. When they
were settled and ready to depart, the lad took his seat behind them
whilst the coachman climbed up onto his box, taking the four reins in
hand ready for the signal to set off. The top of the carriage was folded
down which, along with its low shell, insured that anyone looking on
would have a good view of the couple in all their finery. In readiness
for going away Paulina had changed into a quite plain but full cut skirt
made of a richly patterned ivory silk on top of which she wore a jacket
of a deep red satin silk which was ruffled around the edges as well as
the top and bottom of the narrow cut sleeves. This was her new carriage
costume which had been specially made for use on her honeymoon, her
bride dress being now a discarded thing left behind whilst the rest of
her trousseau already sent on ahead to await her arrival in Gouda. An
ivory lace scarf tied at the high neck of an ivory under blouse
completed the outfit and gave it a slightly jaunty look. Bare-headed as
usual, her only adornment was the earrings which had been a gift from
Johan during their brief courtship and, of course, her golden wedding
ring.

The rump of Johan's musicians and guard of honour led the way out of the
village and along the dyke top, but they had lost some of their
enthusiasm and, for Paulina, all of their rather limited charm so she
was thoroughly relieved when they called a halt at Stolwijkersluis so
that she and Johan could continue the last leg of its journey alone and
in peace. Their escort had served one valuable purpose which was
distract from a sudden reticence that caused a lull in the conversation
between herself and Johan. He seemed rather preoccupied with preening
his uniform and smoothing his hair, having apparently paid scant
attention to her or made any comment on her change of costume. Paulina
was left to gaze rather sullenly at the familiar passing landscape and
try not to feel . Upon their arrival at De Zalm she was disconcerted to
find all his friends and fellow hotel guests assembled outside to greet
him and, rather secondarily it seemed, his wife. She forced her aching
face to smile and her complaining stomach to accept a glass of Champagne
and some savouries from the trays which circulated in quick succession.
Johan was reinvigorated by the attention of his cronies, not to mention
the ingestion of several glasses of Champagne, whilst she was wilting
and starting to doubt her ability to stay on her feet for much longer.

Not at all accustomed to the sensation of physical weakness, Paulina did
not know what to do except try to lean on Johan for support but he had
disappeared into the bustle of people and was lost to her. Suddenly a
maid appeared at her side and suggested that she might like to follow
her inside the hotel to find somewhere quiet to catch her breath. This
pretty little creature seemed to know exactly what was needed and how to
arrange things without making Paulina feel in the least bit inferior or
vulnerable. Paulina followed the maid to a small drawing room where she
was alone and allowed herself to be helped to take a seat in the
protective embrace of a comfortable wing chair. A glass of seltzer water
was fetched and the maid unobtrusively shut the curtains on the sunny
side of the room before asking if there was anything else madam
required. Paulina could think of nothing, nothing at all, so thanked the
young woman and dismissed her with a slight waft of her right hand.

As soon as the maid was gone Paulina started to feel a bleakness of
spirit which only grew worse as she brooded on the thought that Johan
had abandoned her, seemingly heedless of his obligations, on their
special day. She was glad to have the space to recover herself from the
hurley burley outside and yet the notion that Johan had not noticed her
absence and come looking for her promoted a sudden wavering in her
belief in his love and his commitment to their marriage. She started to
sink into a perilous quagmire of hurt and insecurity, a novel sensation
which she did not like at all. As she reached the brink of despair and
peered into the black abyss beyond, the apparatus at the core of her
character stirred into action and drove a rallying of her strength that
energised her will to deal with the situation. She must behave as the
independent woman she knew herself to be deep down and not the sort of
silly person whose role she had rejected not so many weeks ago and in
the very church now just across the Maarkt. On that June day she had
determined to have her own life and not be governed by conventions of
marriage or the demands of a husband.

She had anticipated a period of quiet settling into their rooms would
follow arrival at De Zalm so this was just what she would arrange for
herself. Paulina rose from her chair and rang for a servant. When the
little maid appeared she gave instructions that she wished to be shown
to their rooms where she desired to have tea and cakes brought to her. A
flash of spite held her back from asking for Johan to be informed of her
whereabouts, however. The maid went to fetch a porter with the key and
Paulina followed him up the stairs to the second floor where she was let
into a drawing room at the front of the building. She held out her hand
for the key which the porter hesitantly yielded up in exchange for a
small gratuity, quickly pocketed, before departing to organise her tea
tray to be sent up. Going over to one of the rooms two tall windows she
held back the edge of the net curtain and took in the view of the
Stadhuis and, across the Maarkt, Sint Janskerk. Despite her taut nerves
she could not help but appreciate the outlook and draw comfort and
strength from seeing the tower of the great church rising above the
city.

After some minutes contemplation of the view from the window, she turned
to take in the rest of the room which she saw to be equipped with good
quality, fashionable furniture of a style in keeping with that of the
building itself. Through her visits to Aggie and Theo she was keenly
aware of the controversy which had surrounded the granting of permission
for the original De Zalm, claimed by some to be the oldest inn in the
Netherlands, to be completely remodelled in the style fashionable in Den
Haag. The new building towered over the old Waag, something that could
never have been countenanced in earlier centuries, and its bright, white
exterior dominated the market square and upset many local
traditionalists. Theo had been keen to push for progress and she now
found that she rather approved of what had been achieved, considering
that the old place had been rather dilapidated and vulgar whereas the
room she was standing in was light, tasteful and very respectable.

Aside from the main door leading out onto the landing, there was a
second door in the room which could only lead to the more private
quarters. It stood ever so slightly ajar tempting her to push it further
open whereas she would have hesitated to open a closed door. It was a
heavy door and a tentative nudge only moved it a little but that was
enough to reveal a dresser on which stood an open gentleman's travelling
dressing table case, a selection of its contents having been taken out
for use and left lying on the dresser top beside it. Paulina was rooted
to the spot as she looked at these personal items belonging to Johan and
which now possessed the cachet of marital intimacy. Until now Paulina
had not even considered what married life might mean in the way of such
personal details, having been completely caught up with the event of the
wedding itself. The silver shaving brush and holder, the shaving stick
in its holder, an ivory-backed clothes brush, an ivory-backed hair
brush, various plain glass bottles with silver stoppers and an open red
leather manicure set spoke to Johan's private preparations for the day.
Of course she found Johan handsome and, despite his apparent
carelessness towards her, still she longed to be in his arms again and
quite understood what was to happen to consummate their union. But now,
peeping round the door at these masculine items and imagining him
applying them to his physical person, it struck her full force that
Johan was corporeal and his male body was now part of her life. The idea
confounded her as desire fought with distaste, rooting her to the spot.

Just at that moment the main door to the room opened to the rattling of
things on the tea tray. Paulina quickly turned back into the drawing
room feeling as if she had been caught out like a naughty child. She
expected to see a servant and was even more disconcerted to come face to
face with Johan instead. Unbeknownst to Paulina, the little maid had
taken the liberty, presuming upon their earlier dealings, to approach
Johan and discretely inform him of Paulina's situation and the necessity
for him to go to her. Realizing his oversight Johan had immediately gone
to their rooms, just happening to arrive at the door just as the waiter
with the tea tray was about to knock. He had hurried in ahead of the
man, concerned to compensate for his laxity as a husband with
solicitousness towards the wife he was not yet accustomed to having.

"My dear, I missed you at the party downstairs and grew concerned. Tell
me truly, are you feeling unwell?"

Conscious that the servant might overhear them in their imperfection as
a couple, Paulina waited until the door had closed behind him before
replying;

"I am quite well, thank you. Just a little fatigued but I shall soon be
recovered."

"I am so relieved to hear you say so. I was distressed to think that you
had been taken ill and I was unaware of it. But, here you are and
looking quite the picture of health!"

She had tried to be cool towards him but now that Johan was back with
her she found that she just wanted his arms about her and this had
brought colour into her face. Seizing his advantage, Johan took her in
an embrace whilst saying;

"I took the liberty of asking for an extra cup and plate to be fetched
so that we might take tea together and enjoy being alone. It has been a
marvelous celebration of our marriage and I have revelled in every part
of it but I am also looking forward to your private companionship."

He broke off to kiss her neck and stroke her unruly hair before
continuing;

"Let us keep to ourselves for the rest of today. What do you say? Just
an old married couple spending a quiet night together? "

Before she could reply there was a knock at the door, which caused her
to start and break away from Johan, and the waiter came in with the
extra crockery and cutlery. Once they were alone again, she felt herself
enveloped by Johan as he pressed her close and began gently kissing her
neck then her cheek and finally her mouth. His affection had a calming,
almost soporific, effect on her and she found the closeness of his body
brought her a sense of comfort. Indeed, the feeling she had was
reminiscent of the times when, as a child, she had been soothed and sent
to sleep by snuggling up to her nanny. But Johan was a man with a man's
urges, yet an experienced lover who knew to slacken his embrace before
the urgency of his erection could be felt even through Paulina's thick
petticoats. He knew that he must take care not to cause her any
consternation as that would only make her more resistant to him when the
time came.

The distraction of taking tea was just what was required to soothe them
both in their different ways and to reconcile them to the finality of
their marital pledge. The social routine of an apparently normal evening
provided just enough interest and activity to distract from the tacit
prospect of their impending first sexual encounter. As there was only
one suite of bedroom and dressing rooms and it would have been
unthinkable as yet for both to occupy them simultaneously whilst
changing for dinner, so Johan deferred to Paulina who summoned her maid
and the two women disappeared into the private apartments. Paulina now
saw what lay behind the door which she had earlier peeped round, finding
that her maid had already unpacked her necessary things and laid out her
new dinner dress on the bed. Paulina, with the help of her maid, took
great care over her toilette not simply in order to please Johan but
also as a way of taking the time to calm herself in this rather
thrilling but slightly alarming new situation through the slow
performance of familiar routines.

At last she emerged and accepted Johan's admiration of her appearance.
He had not been idle during her absence having provided a selection of
newspapers and magazines for her to peruse. He had also ordered
Champagne and, in case she might prefer it, Paulina's favourite red
vermouth and some seltzer water all of which were ready for her to make
her selection of beverage. Johan settled her in a chair with all that
she said she required readily to hand before bending to kiss her once
more prior to taking his leave to get changed. In his absence she sipped
some seltzer water and looked through the newspapers for anything about
Haastrecht or anyone of her acquaintance but, since there was very
little to arouse her interest, she began a desultory examination of the
magazines.

She was on the point of having to admit to herself that she was simply
waiting for Johan to return when the bedroom door opened and he rejoined
her, looking very smart in his dinner clothes and smelling of a
pleasingly light and fresh cologne. Johan uncorked the Champagne but she
declined his offer of a glass and he did not entreat her. He did,
however, help himself before drawing his chair close to hers and taking
his seat. They both confessed to being glad to be rid of their bulky and
hot outdoor clothes. It had been an unusually hot day for late summer,
which Paulina felt had blessed their wedding day although she could see
that Johan would have been more affected by the heat in his thick
uniform clothes than she was in her relatively light gown. Johan amused
her with an account of how uncooperative he had found his ceremonial
sword, leaping to his feet to re-enact some of his less adroit moments
as he found it necessary to remove and re-attach this willful prop at
several points during the day. Laughing conspiratorially with him made
her feel that they were sharing a secret which must serve to bring them
closer together.

Johan proposed that they should dine in their rooms, to which she
readily assented feeling that she had been in the public eye quite
enough for one day. Having first solicited her approval, Johan then took
charge of ordering a selection of dishes that he thought to be her
favourites and which he believed that the De Zalm chef could execute to
a high standard. She found it pleasing that he showed himself to be
aware of her tastes in food and honoured that he was so desirous of
ensuring that his knowledge of the hotel kitchen could be applied to
making sure that the best available fare was placed before her. She was
delighted by the sumptuous array of elegantly presented plates that were
placed before them and was eager to sample them all. Oddly, her appetite
somehow deserted her and she found that she could only manage the first
mouthful of each thing on her plate, delicious though everything tasted.
She was grateful for Johan's consideration in that he did not push her
to eat or drink more than she chose to although she noticed that he ate
heartily himself as well as drinking the whole bottle of Champagne.

Once their repast had lost its appeal and the evidence of it had been
cleared away by the servants they found themselves alone again. Paulina
felt a brief flash of awkwardness but Johan soon dispelled any
strangeness between them with his attentiveness and she quickly found
that they were chatting away quite comfortably and finding themselves in
accord on anything and everything. She was charmed by Johan using
endearments without committing the error of being overly familiar. She
also found him quite enchanting in the way he added the frisson of a
little touch here and a kiss there to the rapport developing between
them. He knew exactly how and when to suggest that they prepare for the
night so that it seemed the most natural thing in the world that they
should find themselves alone together in the bedroom after her maid and
his man had been dismissed. She found that he also knew just how to
tantalize them both with glimpses and assurances, kisses and caresses so
that she willingly joined him in the big hotel bed. But once they were
between the sheets with the lamps extinguished the night did not pass
quite as either of them might have predicted.

Maybe Johan had drunk too much Champagne. Perhaps Paulina had become
overheated by his long, slow seduction. Possibly he had been too
proficient in his conquest. Certainly both were overwrought after the
hectic and tiring few weeks leading up to this climax of their nuptials.
It could be that Paulina had shed her sexual inhibitions along with all
the other strictures placed upon a woman of her station in life. What
was certain was that Johan, who had been prepared to coax and cajole his
way into her in the belief that patrician women were not by nature
sexual beings, shrank in the face of her frank interest in his genitals.
She, in turn, was somewhat discomfited that her knowledge of how these
matters proceeded, which had been largely gained in the stables and
farms with little ameliorating advice from her mother, did not lead to
the deflowering she had imagined would follow naturally. She found that
Johan now started to flounder about whilst her efforts became
increasingly fraught and useless until she simply gave up then fell into
a fitful sleep that left her both exhausted and unsatisfied when she
woke the next morning. Her cherished hope of a honeymoon pregnancy now
took on the appearance of a fading dream.

\section{New Year 1871}

\subsection{}

They had travelled to Haastrecht to join the big family gathering at her
parents' house, which Paulina still thought of as 'home', for the
celebration the start of a new year. Aggie and Theo were there with
their brood of eight children as was Uncle Otto and Adelaide with their
six. Next to her own family the le Fevre de Montigny's made a sorry
contribution to the numbers with just one child between them, Gillis and
Mary's small son now aged three. The total of fourteen children whose
ages ranged between two and twenty three along with the mix of adults
who brought with them a variety of ill-concealed tensions made the
assemblage a somewhat complicated one. The more grown up offspring tried
to be part of the adult festivities unaware of ther undercurrents to the
rather strained atmosphere so innocently adding their contribution. The
six little ones became rather rowdy in the excitement of a game of
hide-and-seek in the favourably rambling old \emph{familiehuis}. The
four younsters who were neither children nor yet grown up didn't quite
know what to do with themselves so roamed about feeling awkward,
especially since they were divided equally between two different family
groups so did not know eachother very well.

Paulina had some sympathy with those who seemed out of place among the
party. It was at times like this that she felt something of an odd one
out herself having failed to produce a child after sixteen months of
marriage. She was acutely self-aware that the others were noticing her
barrenness and negatively judging her marriage or, more precisely, her
was distressing and only served to intensify the pain of her unfulfilled
longing for children. She wished that she could tell someone, her mother
maybe or, better still, Aggie, what her situation was but it was too
private a matter to be spoken of. Besides, there had been some sort of
cooling towards her on Aggie's part since she married Johan which she
suspected had its origins in Theo's unspoken but evident disapproval of
her choice of husband.

If she could have spoken out, she would have reassured them that all was
normal with her monthly cycle and that marital relations were not
lacking. Indeed, following the rather disappointing first night their
honeymoon had proved a singular success on all fronts with the exception
that she had not conceived. They had set out from Gouda to take the
train down through Germany where they embarked on a Rhine steamer at
Koblenz for the passage upstream to Mainz through the stunning and
romantic scenery of the Mittelrhein gorge with its vine-clad slopes and
skyline of medieval castles . The passage was a slow one but not without
charm and periods of danger and excitement. Just above Koblenz the
steamer encountered a vast raft of hundreds of tree trunks being swept
downstream towards its destination at Andernach where it was to be
separated into batches for dispersal all across the north of europe.
Even such an experienced sailor as Johan was taken aback by this
enormous platform of timber so vast that the hundreds of men required to
navigate it had built a village of huts on top of it to shelter them on
their long journey north from the upper reaches of the great river. The
pilot of the steamer had a delicate task to peform in order to avoid the
timber raft, which had very little steering, whilst keeping his ship in
the narrow channel cut through the sharp rocks of the river bed.

No sooner was the encounter with the raft safely behind them than they
had cause to marvel again at the pilot's skill as he threaded the
steamer between the many barges transporting their cargoes up and down
the river. Only a small proportion of these commercial vessels were
powered by steam so those under sail on the downstrem run wove and
tacked across their path, bourne down upon the current. Going their way,
steam tugs with their lengthy tows of barges crept upstream impeding the
progress of the faster passenger ship, itself battling upstream against
the strong current. The dogged pounding of the steam engine found its
echo in the progress of Paulina and Johan's physical relationship as
they persevered with the consumation of their union. The strain on their
relationship at last relieved during an overnight stop at Sankt Goar,
they were able to enjoy being on deck the next day to admire the Lorelei
rock around which the river was forced into a trecherously sharp bend
causing notoriously dangerous whirlpools. Soon after this excitement
they came upon the Pfalzgrafenstein castle moored out in the river like
ship of stone whose purpose had been to exact tolls from river users
until just two years previously. They joined in with the spontaneous
cheer that went up from the passengers as the note fo the ships' engine
relaxed once a line from a hauling engine on the bank had been attached
to pull them up through the rapids to their next halt at Bingen.

They finally quitted the Rhine steamer at Mainz to travel on by
stagecoach to Metz . This soon brought them into the still disputed
border between Germany and France following the recent Franco-Prussian
War whose legacy of refugees and the grim evidence of military action
was distressing to Paulina creating the need for the comfort of Johan's
arms at night. Moving into more peaceful territory, they took time to
enjoy the French coutryside as well as the cities of Nancy, Langres and
Dijon before arriving at Lyon where they embarked on another river
steamer, this time going with the current of the river Rhone which
carried them south through Arles and the Camargue to the
Medditterranean. The season was now turning from summer to autumn and
they were glad to be journeying into warmer southern climes where the
freezing of the rivers would arrive somewhat later than at home.

Their passage down the Rhone was quite unlike their earlier Rhine trip.
This time it was the speed of the river that made it thrilling,
compounded by the ever-preesent risk of running aground as a dry summer
had reduced water levels. Although the steam vessels on the Rhone could
make the trip from Lyon to Arles in a day, Johan had arranged for them
to break their journey at Vienne to see the Roman buildings and at
Avignon for the Palace that was once the seat of Popes. Johan had booked
a cabin for the leg of their voyage between these two stops feeling that
because the evenings were lengthening towards winter they would
appreciate having somewhere to retire to for the evening.

After embarking again at Vienne Paulina and Johan went out on deck to
enjoy the warmth of a sunny autumn afternoon as the ship gathered speed
towards the looping curves in the river at Les Roches de Condrieu.
Caught up on the fast flowing current as she took the outside of the
tightest bend it seemed as though the ship was being swept out of
control to only avoided coliding with the right bank butress of the
bridge by dint of good fortune. Paulina clung to Johan as she felt the
danger mounting and was surprised to find that, beneath his calm
exterior, she could sense that he, too, was excited and thrilled. No
word needed to be spoken as they made their hurried towards their cabin
and, once inside, made haste to assist eachother out of the layers of
clothing put on against the chill river airs. Buttons, ties and all
manner of fastenings were dealt with as sleeves, skirts, trousers and
linnen undergarments were made to obey the force of gravity with
embarrassment now giving way to laughter and boisterous delight. They
tumbled together in a tangle of strange bedding within the narrow
confines of their box-like bunk until both were exhausted and completely
sated. They had fallen into a serene doze when the steward knocked on
the door to inform that dinner was soon to be served, causing them to
realize that they were parched and ravenous.

They emerged on deck to the sad sight of the scoured vinyards following
the devastating phylloxera infection which had its origins at Roquemaure
a little to the north of Avignon which Paulina later took to be a
portent of her own barrenness. The warmth of the Medditterranen creeps
up the Rhone valley to temper the climate of Avignon and kept the
passionate connection she had found with Johan alive. This honeymoon
spirit lasted all through their time at Arles but, by the time that they
turned north to climb up into the mountains to Gap, Grenoble, Annecy
then into Switzerland, she knew that she had not conceived. Hope and
longing cooled with the mountain air and the arrival of October. The
change of landscape, archtiecture and a whole way of life mirrored the
calming and cooling between Paulina and Johan as intensity and heat gave
way to less sensual and more regulated emotions.

With Johan at her side she was able to recapture her facsination for the
flora and fauna of the mountains which had had such a profound effect on
her during her first visit in 1865. Together they admired the glaciers
in the Swiss Alps, especially the vast Rhone glacier at Valais and gazed
out over Lake Geneva from the balcony of their hotel room in Lausanne.
Feeling the majesty of the towering mountains and fathomless water and
ice. Then it was time to make the last leg of their journey back to Den
Haag through the familar territory of Germany and The Netherlands to the
anti-climax of a house that was serviceable but still required some work
to bring it up to scratch and the realities of day to day married life.

Now, more than a year on, they had become accustomed to inhabiting a
house that still wanted for its final polish and to their relationship
which had settled down to the comfort of the habitual. Yet, there were
times when they were undeniably at odds with eachother in some way which
neither of them seemed able to fathom or put right. Whilst Paulina's
mind could accept that Johan was free to continue his own life just as
she was still continuing her own occupations and activities just as
before their marriage, there were times when her head could not rule her
sensibilities. She had come to associate her periods of discomfort with
the glimpses she would catch of a strange man who seemed to appear as if
out of thin air and disappear again just as mysteriously. This man had
the effect of causing Johan to immediately order his bags packed for
travelling, pleading business interets that urgently required his
presence. He would leave without giving any indication of where he was
going or how long he expected to be away. Sometimes he returned quickly
but occasionally he was away for some weeks with no word being sent to
her and no means of her being able to contact him. On his return her
never spoke of where he had been, who he had seen, what he had done or
why he had been gone yet he was evidently glad to see her and resumed
their intimacy with some urgency.

\subsection{}

Paulina found herself prey to feelings of boredom and malaise on being
left alone in the house during Johan's unpredictable and secretive
absences. As a seasoned letter writer she longed for a correspondence
with Johan such as she had enjoyed during their brief courtship, at
first continuing to write him letters that were destined to languish
unsent in her bureau drawer. Eventually she gave up this abortive
attempt at correspondence only to fall prey to a need to find some plank
of certainty to support her across the void between them. On one
particularly grey and empty afternoon she found herself loitering
outside the door to Johan's rooms. Although she knew that she was alone
in the house which, in any case, she was mistress of, Paulina still had
to struggle against the idea that trespassing on Johan's private affairs
would somehow cojour up someone on the other side of the door who would
catch her in the act.

Suddenly she was in Johan's drawing room with her back to the door she
had hastily but quietly closed behind her. listening intently for any
disturbance to the silence of the empty house. She had been in this room
often so now her eyes roved around it looking for what was new, what was
missing or any clues to the riddle of his absences. She was well aware
of the fact that many married men took mistresses but it was painful to
think that Johan might be straying so soon after marrying, she believed,
for love and whilst their own passion was not yet spent. Was he was
seeing another woman or even, and this was an excrutiating thought, did
he have a family hidden away somewhere? Of course, she would have to
turn a blind eye, before which she would need to know what it was she
must not see.

The first time Paulina entered Johan's rooms she did not dare to make
more than a cursory inspection of his personal items, not caring to
attribute to herself the judgement she would have passed had she caught
someone else prying into his privacy. However, as her visits became an
established habit so the voice of the moral other gradually quieted, a
danger repeated assuming the safety of a commonplace. She began by
looking inside drawers and cupboards, then would remove and inspect
their contents. Eventually, she crossed the line between curiosoty and
investigation so that the more hidden the item the greater the frisson
gained by removing, inspecting then replacing things exactly as she
found them. She read every paper she could unearth however trivial until
it was unclear whether the challenge of spying had suplanted the need
for certainty in driving her on.

In any case, what she found made no sense. Sometimes his naval things
were missing and she felt secure in the belief that he was at sea until
it occured to her that his life mght be in danger. At other times,
nothing seemed to have been taken apart from the bare minimum required
by a gentleman on the move. His papers mostly referred to business
dealings which her sharp mind for such matters told her were all above
board and in good order. Such items of personal correspondence as he
appeared to have kept mostly related to exchanges of letters with his
brother, her father and, reassuringly, herself. Not a hint of anything
that she could latch onto for an explanation for where her husband was
or what he was doing.

Then, out of the blue, something intruiging to her came along, not
through her snooping, but in the post. She found a letter addressed to
Johan mixed up with her own letters on the silver post tray brought to
her by the maid. Usually Johan's correspondence was sorted from hers and
left on the hall table where Paulina was in the habit of checking for
anything unexpected when she was sure she was not being observed. On
this occasion something out of the ordinary had been literally handed to
her on a plate. She tried to ignore it and attend to her own business
but the tiny envelope with a Rotterdam postmark drew her attention away
from everything else. Had the maid left it on purpose? Would the maid
see her mistake and try to retrieve the letter? Paulina made sure that
she kept the stray item out of sight whenever she thought she might be
disturbed, sneaking looks at the envelope whenever her curiosity had to
be answered. It seemed a long day until the maids went home and Paulina
was alone with what had by now grown into a great mystery. But how to
discover the contents of the envelope without detection?

Remembering that they had a Gazeteer of Rotterdam in the library,
Paulina fetched it and set about interrogating the postmark for clues as
to the business of the area from which the letter had been dispatched.
From what she could gather, the district around the post office
indicated was comprised mainly of the residences of professional people
some of whom had their business rooms as well as domestic quarters at
the same address. She looked at the writing on the envelope for signs of
a legal hand, for example. Oh, but what did she know of such things!
Next she tried to match the initials on the wax seal with those of the
house occupants but this produced a list of a dozen possibilities. Among
the lawyers, university professors, doctors and others on her list one
name stood out because it alone belonged to a woman.

Alone and with no occupation to distract her and nothing else to give
her mind exercise, Paulina began to torment herself with visions of
Johan in the arms of this unknown woman. As night's dark silence spread
throughout the house she could no longer curb her imagination. It became
imperative that she should discover the secret inside the envelope. But
how to break the wax seal? Would it be better to apply heat to melt the
wax or cold to harden it? Heat might leave tell tale smears of red and
blunt the original sharpness of the impressed initials. Cold could only
come from the employing ice which might melt and leave water marks
unlike those naturally left by exposure to rain, and in any case it had
been dry for several days.

As Paulina turned the envelope over and over in her hands she noticed
that the edge of the wax seal was slightly detached. Had someone else
been tampering with it, she wondered? If so, why? The possibility that
she was not alone in having an interest in the contents of the envelope
served to fuel Paulina's desire to open it. She placed it on the silver
plate again then held this over the flame of a candle, thinking to
protect the paper from smoke yet soften the bottom of the wax seal just
enough to be able to remove it. Almost immediately the tray got too hot
for her to hold comfortably so she had to give up on that approach.

Then it occured to her that, just as the letter had been delivered to
her in error, so was it believable that she could have opened it in
error having unthinkingly failed to check that it was, indeed, addressed
to her. Paulina was pleased with this idea, and in no small measure
because it would immediately gratify her curiosity. This plan also had
the benefit of not requiring her to reassemble the letter or conceal
that she had opened it. Acting upon the impulse, she broke the seal,
opened the envelope and soon found herself holding the paper it had been
protecting in her fingers.

It took a while for her to comprehend what she was looking at, so strong
had been her conviction that she would find a lover's note. What she
struggled to make sense of was that this was not, in fact, a letter but
an account for services rendered. The amount was quite modest so not in
itself of any significance to her. What more a source of consternation
was that the name on the paper's heading was that of a doctor and the
account was for a consultation and the provision of medicines as
prescribed. But Johan wasn't ill, she felt sure she would have seen
signs of it if he had been and that he would have consulted their usual
doctor in Den Haag. Yet, the account brooked no other interpretation.
Johan's name and address were on it and whatever ailed him had required
immediate treatment. The fear of johan's infideltity now seemed trivial
in comparison to the fear that he might be concealing a grave illness
from her.

In an instant Paulina's own health worries paled into insignificance.
Her failure to conceive had led her to consult any and every medical
person who might be able to find a cure for her empty womb. She had
submitted to all sorts of unpleasant examinations that had not spared
her blushes or her discomfort. She had been made to answer questions of
a most personal nature concerning her relations with Johan, including
his performance and its outcome. She had received many assurances that
there was nothing wrong with her and no reason why she should not
conceive. Unless, one doctor implied, Johan was at fault. To her
absolute horror, this doctor made the improper suggestion that he might
father her a child himself. Needless to say, she never returned to that
particular person.

Recently she had heard of a new form of treatment at the Zander Clinic
that was soon to open in Amsterdam. She had made an appointment to see
Dr Zander in the hope that he would deem her suitable to become one of
his patients. To her immense relief she found him less concerned than
other doctors with the details of her marital relations. Instead, he
asked a lot of questions about her daily routine her answers to which
seemed to cause him to nod wisely, although he himself said very little
and offered no diagnosis.

Instead, at the end of their interview Dr Zander set out a regime of
exercises using his range of machines that were designed to be suitable
for ladies since there was no need to remove clothing or become over
heated. Dr Zander had explained that his course of treatement would
strengthen the relevant muscles, and here he was mercifully not
explicit, necessary for ease of reproduction. She was shown photographs
of ladies demonstrating the machines, appearing to be comfortably seated
inside the wooden-framed contraptions which, she was assured, were
gentle despite their size. It all seemed so sensible and straightforward
that she was looking forward to starting her treatment and hopeful of
its efficacy.

Now her hopes for Dr Zander and his machines were as nothing when
weighed in the balance against her horror at the kind of serious illness
that could take away Johan's life. Paulina spent the hours of a
sleepless night re-living every moment of her life with Johan looking
for any signs of illness. Then she went over it all again for
indications that he had been unwell but concealed it from her.
Throughout their honeymoon he had been almost constantly in her company
and gave every sign of being in the best of health. Since then, when he
was at home he had given every appearance of rude health leading her to
conclude that if he was concealing something then he was taking such
great pains about it that it had to be a terrible thing. Was this the
explanation for his absences?

Why was Johan keeping secrets from her? She understood that his naval
work might require him to be circumspect in what he divulged. Secretly
she found the possibility that he went on some sort of important and
covert missions gave him an added aura of masulinity and importance that
she found arousing. It pleased her to perpetuate this illusion rather
than the alternative one of another woman, although she knew that there
was no sound basis for either interpretation of his absences. Now faced
with concrete evidence suggesting a third possibilty which did not bode
well for their future, Paulina found herself completely at a loss as to
what to think, say or do.

By opening the letter she had burned her bridges and must now confess
what she had done to Johan. She could try to convince him that she had
realised her mistake and not read the letter once opened, but even a
cursory glance would have been enough to give the game away that Johan
had been seeing a doctor. There was now no going back from a
confrontation with him on the matter of his health. Now she needed to
formulate a plan of what she was going to say to him upon his return
home and when the right moment to say it might be.

Johan had returned home just before Christmas but so far Paulina had not
found the right moment to hand him the doctor's account and to make her
carefully rehearsed speech to him. At first she had not wanted to spoil
their delight at reunion, then they had become caught up in the
celebration of Christmas and a round of social engagements that was now
culminating in a grand party to give thanks for the year departing and
in anticipation of all the blessings in the year to come. Yet Paulina
felt burdened with worries that she had been unable to lighten by
sharing and which left her feeling alone in the midst of company.

\subsection{}

It did not escape Marcellus that hiis daughter was somewhat distant from
the mood of the festive party. An ebullient person himself, he had
usually been able to lift her out of her tendency to melancholy by the
generous application of his own good humour. But they had grown apart a
little since her marriage and she has come to have concerns that were
private from him. She now found that she was unable to respond to him as
she once did, which was painful to her as she could see that he was at a
loss as to how to change his bantering to suit the inevitable shift in
thie relationship now that she was a married woman. What was more,
Paulina could tell that Marcellus was distracted by cares of his own
that even his well-practiced public persona could not conceal from her.

The source of these cares was not hard to find. There was no getting
away from the fact that Oma was failing and, looking back on the last
year, had been increasingly prone to sudden falls although, mercifully,
she had never injured herself seriously. Yet each time she had taken
longer to recover from the bumps and bruises, relying more and more on
her nurses to get through each day. Her mental world had shrunk as much
as her physical world so that now her attention could only be persuaded
to focus on her own immediate concerns and a few accounts of past events
that were worn to word perfection in the repeated telling. Nobody
appeared able to distract, much less interest her, to the extent that
Paulina sometimes wondered if Oma really knew who she was any more.

May God punish her for the thought but old people perish and Paulina
wished for Oma's end to be soon, swift and easy rather than a long,
drawn-out decay as the remaining strength of her body fought to keep
captive the last whisp of a spirit that had already largely departed.
Surely her father was preparing himself for whatever course Oma's last
weeks and months might take and the inevitable conclusion. Unless
Paulina was very much mistaken, her father had something more serious on
his mind irectly upon their returnthan old Oma's health.

The reason for her father's disquiet soon became apparent to Paulina as
she took Johan's arm to follow her parents into the Grote Salon for
dinner. This was the first time for a long while that she had really
looked at her mother and was shocked to see how old and worn out she had
become and how she seemed to need to lean on her father for physical
support. A great wave of anxiety passed over Paulina as, on top of all
her other worries, she now understood that there was something amis with
hreer mother's health. She had been half expecting Oma to be showing
signs of her mortality but for her mother to be treading the same path
did not bear thinking about.

What Marcellus could see and Paulina could not was the toll that
Paulina's marriage and Oma's decline had taken on Maria's health.
Without Paulina's constant presence and able assistance the extra work
Maria now undertook in the management of their business and estate
affairs was gradually draining her strength. That he had married a woman
some years his senior who was now herself becoming elderly was making
itself evident as she tired more easily and seemed to be losing the
sharp edge of her aptitude and acumen in managing their affairs. Yet she
was still as able as ever at organising the social events that were such
an intergral and important part of his political career. But even in
this sphere she was under added pressure now that his mother's decline
was putting her in the way of extra work and worry in the management of
the household.

He had lain awake at nights trying to come up with a way to give his
wife an easier life. Every plan that he had contrived so far had
involved Paulina's return to he family house. He had entertained the
hope that giving him a grandchild and heir would rouse in her the sort
of familly feeling that would make it easier for him to persuade her to
come back to Haastrecht. Now he was starting to consider what else might
prove incentive enough to persuade her away from city life in Den Haag.
Of course, it wasn't just Paulina that he had to take into consideration
but also Johan, a man whose lifestyle was a mystery to him being so very
different from anything Marcellus could relate to. He searched his mind
for anything they might have in common on which to attempt to build an
alliance. This train of thought at least had the advantage of giving him
the feeling that there was something he could do to achieve the end he
desired, even though he did not yet know what it might be.

Had Paulina but known it, Marcellus had a lift to his shoulders as he
led the way into dinner as a result of feeling that he had some measure
of control over the worrying developments in his domestic life. More
usually of late he had exhibited an air of dejection about his posture
which would have further upset Paulina had she witnessed it.

\subsection{}

Before she and Johan left to return to Den Haag Paulina made sure that
she found an opportunity to speak privately with her father. He did not
take much persuading to share his anxiety about the state of her
mother's health and they fell to discussing remedies for the overwork
which they both thought was at the bottom of her physical decline.
Paulina quickly pledged to spend more time at Haastrecht in order to
relieve her mother of as much of her work as she would allow. Johan
would understand and her romantic steak envisaged that their letters and
his visits might bring reawaken the internsity of their courtship.

As well as a permanent lightening of her duties, father and daughter
also agreed that Maria would need some period of rest and recuperation
to restore her to her previous state of health. Their discussion moved
on to how to persuade Maria to take a complete break from her duties,
something which she was unlikely to do, or be given the peace to do,
unless she was away from home and and all its demands for a while. They
considered which of their relatives and friends might be able to give
Maria the peace and tranquility she would need for her recovery and who
she would not mind being lodged with. It went against the grain for
either of them to think of asking a favour of even the closest of
relations and they knew that Maria would hate to be put in the position
of self-invited guest, nomatter how weighty the reason behind it. Then
Paulina recalled hearing talk of the benefits to be gained from visiting
the mineral spas in Germany whose names all seemed to begin with Bad.
Her father greeted this suggestion with enthusiasm and undertook to
speak to their doctor about which of the many cures he would recommend
for Maria.

Directly upon their return to Den Haag Johan and Paulina went to their
separate quarters to await the announcement of dinner, as had become
their domestic habit. However, on this occasion Paulina soon came to the
conclusion that she would have to instigate some sort of discussion with
her husband about the several matters that were weighing heavily on her
conscience. The couple were not accustomed to sitting down together for
the purposes of having a serious conversation about the state of their
private affairs as a result of which a joint view or mutually agreed
course of action might emerge. Instead, they each went their own way, as
Paulina had envisaged they would, only informing each other of what they
were doing as a matter of courtesy and only when necessary at that. Now
Paulinia had to overcome her anxious state and find a way to take the
initiative in engagaing Johan in a conference.

She sent her maid to set out a tray of drinks in the salon in order to
tempt Johan into accepting her invitation to join her there. Having
dispatched her maid with this invitation, Paulina did her best to smooth
her appearance and cool her head before going to the salon to wait for
him. Johan found his wife's invitation slightly odd but he did not
hesitate to rise to what he decided to take at face value as being a
social approach with the added bonus of alcohol on offer. He arrived at
the salon to find his wife looking more ill at ease than welcoming.

Paulina struggled to keep her composure and not show her impatience as
Johan fussed over glasses, decanters, bottles and cigars whilst making
easy small talk. At last they were seated either side of the fire place
in the apparent ease of a settled married couple and Paulina looked for
an opportunity to shift the ground of their encounter and reveal the
motive to her invitation. Taking advantage of a lull in Johan's chatter
as he lit a taper from the fire and applied it to his cigar, Paulina
gathered herself and began the speech which she had carefully prepared
beforehand.

"My dear, there are some matters about which we should have a serious
discussion. Mainly they concern my mothger's health - and yours."

Her last two word suddenly caught Johan's attention, an expression
wavering between guilt and bewilderment passing across his face. Without
pausing to give him a chance to speak, she produced the letter
containing the doctor's bill from her skirt pocket as she continued;

"Let us take this latter concern first, then. This letter addressed to
you found its way among correspondence sent to me and I confess to
opening it in error, not having read the envelope carefully enough. I
find its contents rather disturbing."

Handing the item in question over to its rightful recipient, she
continued;

"Disturbing on two counts. First, that you are ill and, second, that you
have hidden this fact from me."

Here she deliberately paused to give Johan time to open and read the
doctor's invoice then come up with a response to her raising of the
matter. She waited longer than was entirely comfortable as it seemed to
her that Johan was visibly struggling to compose himself.

"I am deeply ashamed that you have caught me out in a small dishonesty
in concealing this from you. But, in my defence, the consultation
alluded to in this invoice revolved around such a trivial ailment that
it must have slipped my mind to tell you of it."

"so, my dear, whatever is the matter that you could not see our own
doctor?"

"let me assure you that there is nothing sinister about my action.
Merely the convenience of going to a doctor well versed in the disorders
common among memebers of the marine. Something that I contracted during
my time at sea sometimes threatens to recurr and did so whilst I was
visiting Gillis so I sought out a medical man I had consulted in the
past who is familiar with such problems and their treatment. Please be
ressured that it signifies nothing at all serious or of any danger to
you."

Paulina was a bit thrown by the gravity of his last remark but did not
question it as she was preoccupied with her own pressing concerns.

"I have to ask: Might it have a connection to our failure to produce
children, and does it have anything to do with your absences from home
about which you tell me so little?"

This double question came as a challenge to Johan, its boldness aiming
directly at two matters of such a private nature that he found himself
suddenly off guard and on the defensive. The first question was simply
too intimate and threatening to his masculinity for him to be able to
take in, never mind address thoughtfully. The second question defaulted
as the lesser of two evils but still defied his considered reply.
Instead, Johan found that he had made a snap decision to trust his
wife's discretion if he confided in her the reasons for his secretive
absences with not a little desire that this would distract her from
persuing and answer to her first, and simpler, question.

"What I have to tell you must not be divulged or even hinted at to
another living soul. Before I begin, do you swear to me that you will
never betray the confidence which I am about to put in your discretion,
not even to allude to what I am about to tell you when you write in your
journal?"

"Oh my goodness! This sounds grave indeed!"

"Do I have your word?"

"The swear it!"

"Johan, you are frightening me!"

"I have good reason for this. Do you swear secrecy?"

"Yes, then, I swear on my life that I will keep what you tell me hidden
inside and not whisper a word of it."

"Good. I am sorry to upset you but you will soon see why it was
necessary.

I am often called away on matters of importance to our country and its
international affairs. I can give no better illustration than what is
about to occur. But before I go any further, may I ask if I am correct
in surmising that you also wish to talk to me about your mother's health
and your desire to spend a good eal of time in Haastrecht with the aim
of easing her burden of work?"

Paulina nodde in assent, realizing that her account of her talk with her
father which she had given to Johan during their journey home would have
made him aware of the topic she was hoping to broach with him later.

"I should tell you that I, too, have to be away from home and that my
business may take some time. You may have heard or read in the
newspapers that Prussia is likely to defeat France in the current war
between them. This will result in the unification of all the German
states creating a lengthy border between us and them. Feeling empowered
by their success over the Fench, it is feared that their attention may
next turn to encroaching on our territory.

As far as my involvement goes, there is a fear that the Prussian navy
will make an incursion into the Friesian Islands and threaten our trade
routes to the Zuiderzee and north coat ports, perhaps even beyond. As we
speak, I am awaiting a summons to join the Dutch fleet bound for the
waters off Denmark."

Paulina interrupted with a question she just had to know the answer to;

"Will the summons come in the shape of that peculiar little man I catch
sight of fromn time to time? He never looks the same twice running but
you alwaysnseem to go away just after I glimpse him."

"Yes. he is an agent of the Rpyal Family and usually so discrete as to
barely visible. It was extraordinarily observant of you to notice him
and clever of you to connect him with my departures."

"Johan, I have been so anxious about what clandestine purposes lie
beneath these brief desertions that I have become extremely vigilant for
any sugns that might point to an explanation of what is going on."

"Such as a letter? Or going through my things?"

Now it was Paulina's turn to feel embarrassed.

"Oh, my love, please do not concern yourself! It isflattering and
reassuring that you still care so much since our marriage has had its
disappointments for you, I know. I admire your initiative in spying on
me and your bravery in confronting me today. I like you the better for
it."

There was a brief lull in their talk as each adjusted their
understanding of the other and took in the shift to a more open basis to
their relationship now that things had been said which were previously
left unsaid. Johan took a long draught of his drink and a pull on his
cigar as he ordered his thoughts and considered how best to continue.

"I have a special talent which the marine has serious need of. Although
I left the service some time ago, I am honour bound to answer the King's
call whenever it comes. This is how I remain entitled to still wear my
uniform whenever I so choose.

Oh, don't look so surprised, my dear. I know that I must seem a dull wit
when held up to the men in your family, but I am not totally lacking in
intellect. I have a gift with maps: reading them, interpreting the land
and sea scape depicted by them and for making maps which others can
easily comprehend. This is of strategic importnace for the defence of
our country and for the conduct of international affairs.

My next mission will involve me in a detailed survey and mapping of the
area at risk from the Prussian navy. The aim is to determine where a
fleet might penetrate our defences, where a ship might hide itself close
to land, where a boat might land a spy or armed forces, and so on. My
cartography is needed in these matters and is of importance in deciding
how we might deploy our own forces defensively."

Paulina hardly dare ask the obvious question;

"Will you be in danger?"

Johan paused before answering, briefly pondering how truthful he should
be, not wanting to worry Paulina then realizing that she would worry
nomatter how he played down the risk.

"I will be honest with you, my love. Yes, there will be some danger
involved over and above the usual perils of the sea. As I said, there is
a war and both Prussia and France have their spies about who will use
force against anyone seen as thwarting their efforts at gaining
advantage. There is always a chance that we will run into trouble
despite our best efforts to be clandestine and cautious. I am not a
reckless man so I shall be as careful of myself as is consistent with
achieving the desired ends."

"And will this work require you to be away from home for long?"

"Again, I'm afraid that I must answer in the affirmative. There is a lot
of coast and sea to map with many islands, sandbanks and complex tide
lines to be accurately rendered. Some of these are subject to alteration
by the action of the sea so will need to be charted again and again to
maintain accuracy. Our mission also involved reporting on any unusual
vessels or activity, which will also keep us at sea for long periods.
You will by now appreciate that all of this means that I shall be unable
to send word to you or receive any of your dear letters.

So, it is for the best that you go to Haastrecht where you will be
occupied and thus somewhat distracted from concerns about me. You will
have the comfort and support of your family and friends ad the
satisfaction of knowing that you are doing all you can for Maria and
Oma."

A rapid succession of thoughts and feelings swept through Paulina as she
grappled with a new understanding of her husband and an altered
appreciation of her marriage. Now that Johan had explained everything
she found that she felt less rather than more anxious. Now that her
suspicions about his infidelity had been laid to rest she felt a sense
of relief that their marriage was not under threat. More than that, she
found her feelings for her husband were strenghthening now thathe was
turning ouit to be a gifted man who was engaged in important work in the
service of their King and country. It must be admitted that her pride in
being his wife was starting to tarnish as he had every appearance of
lacking any occupation. Being raised to hard work as a duty it had been
hard for not to think less of him for his seeming idleness. She was
overcome by a sudden rush of love and desire for him that reminded her
of their courtship and the best parts of their honeymoon.

Johan, of course, discerned the subtle alteration in his wife which
signalled the re-awakening of her desire. He rose and fetched her a
small glass of the red vermouth she had a afondness for, taking the
opportunity to lean close to her as he handed her the drink. He rested
his hand lightly on her shoulder for a few seconds, laying the
groundwork for later intimacies.

The tie for deep conversations thus reached its conclusion without
further concerns surfacing. Paulina would have liked to return to the
theme of their childlessness but feared that crossing the bounds of
delicacy, even between husband and wife, might destroy the atmosphere of
closeness which had developed between them during the course of the
evening. The prospect of a prolonged separation, entailing Johan's
absence from her bed, was setback enough to her hopes of motherhood,
although she knew that this could not be helped.

On Johan's part, he was all too willing to let the subject of his
medical situation drop. It had given him a nasty moment when Paulina
produced the doctor's bill and he had had to think on his feet to come
up with some sort of plausible explanation for it. He hadn't exactly
lied in what he had said, but he hadn't been entirely honest either.
But, a risk of discovery past is a risk forgotten so his mind focussed
on managing a smooth progress towards bedding Paulina.

\section{Summer 1871}

Joahn's sea chest had stood next to Paulina's trunks and boxes in the
voorkammer of Van den Boschstratt 12 as the couple made their farewells
on a freezing January morning. Four months had now passed since that day
when the Den Haag house had been shut up and Paulina moved back to the
family home in Haastrecht. Paulina had gradually taken over her mother's
tasks as Maria's poor health forced her to relinquish them bit by bit.
Once settled back into her old room, Paulina had found it easy to fall
back into the old routines and habits of the Haastrecht life she had led
before her marriage. Indeed, she found that for long periods she could
forget that she was married, especially with the added burden of all her
mother's work. This state of affairs made it easier to bear the total
absence of any communication for Johan and distracted her from her
anxiety for his safety. From time to time she felt a pang of remorse at
just how easily she had abandoned her recent life style which made her
feel as though she had rejected her marriage to Johan.

For all that, things at the Bisdom van Vleit house were not quite the
same as they had been two years previously, and not just because Paulina
herself had been changed by her married life (how?). She found her
father to be even more busy with his Rotterdam business interests which
were causing him some concern since profits were not holding up as well
as he wpuld have hoped. At home, his political involvements were not
pleasing everyone locally so he had found himself the subject of a
number of ungrateful lampoons. His progressive ideas for land drainage
did not meet with universal favour, especially his plans for the
installation of steam pumping engines. He was encountering resistance to
such technological advances so keeping this project moving forward
required his constant vigilance and the devotion of both time and energy
in chivying people along in order to get the work done.

Once Paulina was installed and doing everything that was required it was
time to arrange a spa cure for Maria, whose complaints were
problematically hard to specify that the type of cure that would benefit
her was not easy to identify. She said that she lacked her usual energy
and certainly seemed to need to rest more than ever before. Her
appetitie was sometimes slight so she was becoming thinner and suffered
with irregularity in her habits. Climbing the stairs made her gasp for
air yet she had no cough. The doctor could find no diagnosis and
wondered aloud if she might simply be affected by a nervous disorder.
Paulina thought this unlikely as her mother had always been a strong
woman although she had to concede that her mother had been working
increasingly hard, as her own experience of stepping into her shoes
attested. Eventually they settled on Bad Ems as the solution beacause of
its ease of access by train, spa waters efficacious for chest and
digestive problems, stunning environment and social cachet. The end of
the Franco-Prussian War in early May meant that travel across the border
was once again reliable and safe So, preparations completed, Paulina and
her father saw Maria and her entourage off with high hopes for the
benefits of the cure before both returned to their duties.

Paulina soon received a letter from her mother giving an account of the
regime at her hotel. It did not sound either very appealing or very
restful and Paulina was glad that she did not need such a 'cure'. The
day began with a glass of water from the Kraechenbrunnen spring to
aeraeted he mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and a glass from
the Kesselbrunnen spring to stimulate the secretions of the digestive
tract. The action of the latter was assisted by a gentle stroll beside
the River Lahn whose real attraction seemed to come from the opportunity
to spot the royalty and famous artists from europe and beyond who
happened to be in town at the time. More water was drunk before lunch
and in the late afternoon with further application of spa waters through
inhalation and warm baths. Eating and socialising, it seemed, left
little time to retreat to the quiet of her room. At the conclusion of
her letter, Paulina's mother sought to reassure her that she was
confident in the positive effects of the cure over the ensuing weeks.

It was shortly after this letter that word reached Paulina and Marcellus
that Maria had been unable to complete her stroll in the spa gardens
despite the assistance of a walking stick and the support of her maid. A
bath chair had been sent for and she had not felt up to leaving her room
since having been helped back to the hotel. Paulina an her father made
arrangements to go to Bad Ems to see Maria but felt no sense of urgency
or gravity about their visit, each convincing the other that Maria's
collapse was to be explained by the results of all her exertions at home
finally catching up with her now that she could relax at last. The
reality was that by the time Maria had arrived in Bad Ems it was already
too late for her to recover.

\subsection{}

Paulina and her father arrived in Bad Ems fully expecting to witness
Maria making steady improvement as the cure combined with complete rest
had their beneficial effects. Once Paulina saw the Bad Ems for herself
she was even more convinced of its restorative properties. Here the
River Lahn flowed through a steep, wooded valley between the Westerwold
and Taunus mountains providing a magnificent backdrop to the town. A
striking river frontage had been created by the architecture of the
Staadsbad, Kursaal and Casino as well as the opulent hotels all aound.
Grand villas were colonising the less sunny southern bank and churches
of all denominations seemed to be springing up everwhere to cater for
the varied spiritual needs of the shifting population. She quickly
determined that such physical beauty combined with a tranquil ambience
could not fail to restore her mother in both mind and body.

Indeed, her mother rallied upon their arrival, managing to eat a little
of the delicious food on offer as well as drinking the prescribed
glasses of mineral waters. She seemed to rest peacefully in her room
after meals, so Paulina and her father ocupied themselves with outings
which took them increasingly further away from the hotel. At times, she
even felt as though she were on an adventurous trip just like her
excursion through the Alps or her honeymoon. She forgot about her
mother's state of health for hors at a time so preoccupied was she with
all the new experiences Bad Ems and its surrounding brought to her.

At first, Paulina and her father took strolls around the town where
everywhere they encountered fashionably dressed members of Europe's
royalty, aristocracy and wealthy classes could be seen taking the air on
the riverside promenades or exploring the many other attractions on
offer. Paulina found herself even more fascinated by the less regal and
more unusual residents of the town. Chatting with new acquaintances, she
discovered that a number of well-known writers and artists were there to
take advantage of the creative atmosphere and ready source of patronage.
The lone, tall stooping figure of Turgenev, and the more attractive
Dostoyevsky accompanied by his second wife, Anna, were pointed out to
her as memeber sof the Russian crowd. However, most of the whisperings
amongst her fellow guests related to craggy old Richard Wagner and his
wife, Cosima, more than twenty years youger than him, and the scandal
surrounding their previously adulkterous relationship and brood of
illegitimate children. The rather gruff-looking Victor Hugo was said to
be taking the cure to aid his recovery from near starvation during the
Prussian siege of Paris during which, paulina was alarmed to learn, he
was forced to eat animals from the zoo. She listened with mounting
horror to the romantic story of the death of his favourite daughter when
she fell out of boat into the River Seine and was drogged under the
water by the weight of her sodden skirts, her young husband joining her
in death as he entered the water trying to save her.

Exploring further, they climber up to the Concordiaturm to enjoy the
splendid view of the Lahn valley from the viewing platform atop the
tower. Paulina found this excursion quite exhausting so was glad that
the next trip was by boat along the river followed by a train journey
further along the Lahn Valley Railway. The train took them to the city
of lLmburg, the track winding along beside the river, halting at seven
stations before their detsination. There was plenty of beautiful scenery
to admire from the carriage window, but the elevn tunnels which
interrupted the view provided a modicum of thrill also.At Limburg they
hired a cab to drive them around the

1972, the houses were carefully restored. Among the best known

They recounted all their adventures to Maria who seemed interested in
everything they did. Paulina suggested to her father that one of their
local discoveries might be something that her mother could be persuad,
Fench ambassador to Prussia, during their famed conversation in the
Kupark the previous July. Otto Van Bismark's rather manipulative account
of what was reutedly a very friendly talk was known as the Ems Dispatch,
its blunt tone was generally regarded as having triggered the
Francvo-Prussian was that had ended only a metter of days earlier.
Maria's doctor was consulted about the proposed outing He pronounced
that a short excursion in the warm summer air and with good company
could only do her good as she seemed to be on the road to recovery.
Paulina's father arranged a dog cart into which Maria was helped then,
Paulina and her father walking alongside, was driven to the very spot
where this diplomatic event took place. Now confident of the eventual
her mother's restored health, Paulina felt relaxed and thoroughly
entered into the spirit of the afternoon.

Paulina and her father made arrangements for their return to Haastrecht
on the following day. As soon as they had made their farewells Maria
collapsed, exhausted by her efforts on behalf of her husband and
daughter. She had not wanted them to see how weak and ill she felt as it
would only cause them to worry and that was pointless as there was
nothing they, or anybody, could do to change the situation. She soon
became confined to her room, then took to her bed. The doctors and
nurses could plainly see that she was slipping away, despite their best
efforts and previous optimism. Paulina and Macellus had barely had time
to settle down back at Haastrecht before a further summonds to Bad Ems
arrived. Still unprepared for the gravity ofthe situation, they made no
haste in arranging for their return to Bad Ems. On 7th June Maria died
quietly and alone, aged 67.

\subsection{}

If Paulina had thought herself busy before, then the death of her mother
left her with not a second to spare in the day. Organising a funeral had
the added complication of Maria's body being in Ems but her burial to
take place in Haastrecht, some considerable distance away and across the
border between two nations. It was agreed that Marcellus would return
home in order to take up his duties there as best he could in the
circumstances. Paulina was to remain in Germany to take care of
formalities there before accompanying her mother's body back to
Haastrecht. Before his departure Paulina had armed her father with a
list of things he needed to do once back home but she rather suspected
that pressing matters of other kinds would distract him from giving her
instructions his full attention. She was fairly confident that her
father's friendship with the Pastor and good business relationship with
their lawyer would progress some matters. What was less certain was the
commissioning of a new grave stone and the making of arrangements for
its installation, not to mention the detailed preparations for the
interrement itself. She would have to keep and eye on him if everything
was to go smoothly.

Paulina returned to her hotel room and the many tasks which now vied for
her time and attention. Etiquette dictated that she should only appear
in public wearing mourning clothes but she had nothing suitable with
her. A local seamstress was summoned on the recommendation of the hotel
manager. The woman gace assurances that she could produce sufficient
garments to satisfy society by the next day. Measurements were taken,
fabrics chosen and designs recommended with facilitating a speedy
outcome in mind. Then the miliner arrived with a selection of
appropriate hat and veils from which Paulina selected something that
would sit as decorously as was feasible atop her unruly hair.
Fortunately she had gloves and boots in black so did not need to trouble
herself to acquire these. Attention to her appearance was but an
irritating interruption to the constant stream of correspondence that
flowed from Paulina's pen, including instructions for further garments
and accessories from her own seamstress which were to await her arrival
back home.

Having sent out for a quantity of black edged notepaper and envelopes,
she began the work of writing to all the names on the list of family and
friends she had compiled, informing them of Maria's passing. Once she
had word from her father of the date and time of the burial she could
pass these details on to the close family members who would attend the
house for prayer and meditation led by the Pastor before moving on to
the burial itself. Although the family had a vault inside the church, a
law passed in 1829 forbade further interior burials so Maria would be
interred just outside the church walls in ground which was once the
choir of the old church which burnt down in 1624 but was never
completely re-buit. Hopefully, this would still give access to the
family vault just the other side of the church wall thus meeting the
need of the family whilst staying within the law. Oh, how Paulina wished
that she could include Joahn in her letters! She would just have to make
do with dashing off notes to her father as matters requiring his
attention came to her mind.

It was not all writing, however. There was a doctor to be seen in order
to obtain a death certificate and medical documents necessary to
transporting a corpse back to Holland. He did, of course, have to be
paid, too. Then undertakers were summoned and the business of selecting
a suitable casket (kist) gone through. Paulina tried to choose something
which she though would have met with her mother's approval and which
reflected the family's station in life. The undertaker semed to endorse
the outcome before departing with haste in order to prepare the deceased
for her last journey by suitable preservation, dressing her hair and
applying the make-up which would lessen the waxy look of death and
create the illusion of a living complexion. Lastly, with the help of his
wife, he would clothe her in the garments and jewelery which Paulina had
provided before arrangeing her in the casket and sealing it for
transportation.

This final journey itself necessitated a not inconsiderable feat of
organisation but the undertaker was no stranger to the deaths of
foreigners in Bad Emms so knew the ropes. First, a hearse and mourner's
carriage would convey the parties to the railway station, a short
distance but the proprietes of a glass hearse and black carriage both
drawn by plumed black horses were observed. A floral tribute of suitable
size would top the casket and must be made using the most expensive and
rare blooms. Two chief mourners would walk before the funeral courtage
and remain at the bereaved's disposal throughout the journey to Gouda
where a local undertaker would receive the party. Pall bearers would
follow the cortege ready to transfer the coffin from hearse to train,
then between trains at Koblenz, Koln and Utrecht. These men would also
stand guard outside the compartment containing the coffin to ensure the
deased's privacy and safety. All these mourners would need to be
provided with a compartment where they could take rest and refreshment
on both the outward and return legs of their journey. Paulina's own
food, drink and personal comfort also needed to be arranged. Things
began to fall into place when her new clothes arrived and were to her
liking. Up until now she had not left her room so, now that she was
suitably attired, she was glad to go out for some fresh air and to
receive and acknowledge in person the condolences of fellow guests. But
she only began to properly relax once the travel home had all been
planned down to the last detail, inlcuding the choice of her personal
menus and stipulation of her meal times. There were even contingencies
in place in the event of missed connections, inefficiencies on the part
of railway staff or other unforseen delays.

\subsection{}

It was a long, grim day for Paulina as she accompanied her Mother's
casket (kist) back to Gouda during which she retreated into herself. Her
habitual recourse of writing in her journal, composing poetry and
writing letters to her friends was denied her by the jolting and swaying
of the train which rendered even her large and fluid script distorted
into illegibility. Even the diversion of reading was denied her as
focussing on the unstable page brought on feelings of nausea, even were
she in a frame of mind to concentrate on the story. So, she spent most
of the journey gazing out of the compartment window without registering
the changeing landscape or the towns and cities passing by.

Finally arriving at Gouda, her wits were so dulled that she allowed
herself to be scorted onto the platform by the Chief Mourner on duty and
passed into the care of his opposite number from the Gouda firm. She
felt herself being handed on to yet another man who had the boldness to
put his arm around her shoulder. She suddenly jerked into awareness at
this unwarranted intrusion upon her person, experiencing a moment of
utter confusion as a familiar voice struggled for recognition and
location in the man in such intimate contact with her. It was Theo! At
last she could let go of the need to hold herself up under the burdens
of the previous days, weeks and months and relinquish all to Theo's
care. It was such a relief to find herself safely ensconsed inside The
Haven.

Paulina soon realized that Theo had in fact taken charge of everything
at Haastrecht. He had taken Marcellus to The Haven and she was shocked
to see him looking so worn and ashen, barely able to raise a smile at
the sight of his daughter. It seems that he had been carrying out his
business and public duties as usual, preferring to keep busy rather than
sit and rhuminate on his loss.Paulina felt much the same, being of the
opinion that life goes on and it does nobdy any good to simply succumb
to emotion. Unfortuntaley, she found that this is just what Aggie had
done. As soon as she saw her sister, Aggie fell against her in floods of
tears, clinging to Paulina like a drowning woman. Reluctantly, Paulina
put her arms around her step-sister and tried to summon the energy to
comfort her whilst willing her to pull herself together. In the end it
was Theo who gently detatched his sobbing wife, helped her to a seat in
an armchair then wrapping her in a shawl and putting her feet up on a
footstool. His solicitousness caused Paulina a sharp stab of regret that
Johan was absent.

As if reading her mind, Theo came to her with an account of the efforts
which he ahd amade to try and reach Johan through his contacts, calling
in some of the favours he was owed. Although nothing was certain, he had
a feeling that a message had reached Johan's ship and that it might be
possible, but not to raise her hopes too high, that he could be
discretely landed somewhere. Clearly Thoe knew more about Johan's
activities than she did, or he had previously divulged, but it did mean
that he could give her good news about this welfare despite all the
other uncertainties. For now, it was a relief to Paulina to be back
among her family with her burden shared.

Cook had prepared a selection of savouries and cakes for a light supper
which the maid had laid on a small table in the salon. Theo pressed a
small glass of sweet wine on both Paulina and Aggies before pouring a
healthy measure of cognac for Marcellus and himself. The diminished
family groupArranged themselves around the table then toyed with the
food whilst managing to make small talk by dint of long-establishes
social habit. Paulina soon felt her eyelids begining to droop and had to
beg to be excused to her room. There she found that her own maid from
home had already laid out her nightgown and prepared hot water so that
she may wash away the soot of the trains and the grime of travel.
Grateful to feel clean and be released from her corsets, Paulina was
soon fast asleep in the arms of a large, soft feather bed.

\subsection{}

In the early hours of the morning word had reached The Haven that Johan
had arrived at his brother's house and had elected to rest there before
making the journey to Gouda in time to join the funeral cortege for the
journey to Haastrecht. Gillis had been shocked by the sight of his
brother. Unsurprisingly, Johan was salt encrusted, sooty, and generally
dirty but he also smelled rather repulsively of rancid fish oil, not to
mention neglected bodily hygeine. But more than this, he looked far more
unhealthy than could be accounted for by his arduous journey home or the
rigours and deprivations of life at sea. He had lost weight but that
wasn't the worst of it. His face beneath the beard growth was covered in
small ulcers and scabs which he passed off as salt burns from the
lashing of sea spray whilst on deck. He vehemently denied feeling ill
saying that he just needed time to recover himself.

By the time Johan presented himself to Paulina later that morning he had
bathed, shaved and was dressed in his good, black clothes. A faint fishy
odour hung about his person despite the liberal application of cologne
in an attempt to cover it. He had also tried to conceal the mess that
was made of the skin on his face by shaving across a rash of small scabs
and lesions by the application of pigmented ointment but this hadn't
been entirely successful as it created a complexion of a most unnatural
colour and texture. Furthermore, beneath the fumes of cognac on his
breath there lurked a rottenness from within. Paulina had expected to
fall into his arms after so long a separation but found him rather
repulsive. He didn't force the matter, either, creating an atmosphere of
strained politeness between them. Paulina wondered just how much he was
hoping to keep hidden from her than was necessary and despite his
protestsations of opennes when she had broached the subject of his
secrecy back in Den Haag. Indeed, she was quite distracted from the
purpose of the day, having to be shephered through it all by Johan and
Theo.

During the carriage journey to Haastrecht Paulina sat between Marcellus
and Johan in what promissed to be a leaden silence because of the
straied atmosphere and the Marcellus's growing morbid pre-occupation
with the hearse in front of them and the the casket it contained. Then
Johan suddenly decided to entertain father and daughter with a lively
account of his tortuous journey back to Gouda. This began with a
hazardous transfer from his ship to a small, local fishing boat in a
rolling sea, followed by an uncomfortable run to the fishing port
ofZoutkamp on the coast to the north of Groningen,. This gave him the
opportunity to explain away the state of his face by means of a dramatic
enactment of being repeatedly stung by salt water spray. Once ashore, he
had engaged in canny negotiations with the skipper of a Tjalk (?)
conveying smoked eels to market in Groningen before he was granted
passage. Keen to be under way, the skipper had frustratingly elected to
wait for the most favourable run of the tide to assist the sails in
carrying them along the Reitdiep. Johan feared that being in close
quarters with the smoked eels for such a length of time might have left
him with an unfortunate fragrance, a point with which father and
daughter could only tacitly concur. From Groningen he could reached
Rotterdam by train but a badly timed conncetion meant that this seemed
to take forever. After just a short time with his brother, he had needed
to leave at the crack of dawn to make the train for Gouda in order to be
in time to be with them before they left for Haastrecht.

Grudgingly, Marcellus and Paulina had been distracted by Johan's
recounting of his tale, which had managed to consume the whole of the
ride to Haastrecht. Nevertheless, they were glad to arrive and gain
release form the close confines of the carriage. The Pastor was waiting
at the house to greet them, ushering them into the grand salon where
Otto and Adelaide were waiting. Paulina registered their recoil at the
sight of Johan in the instant before they regained control of their
epressions. She surmised that they were thinking that he looked more
embalmed than her mother, whose closed casket meant that they would not
be able to make the actual comparison.

Poor old Oma, who had not expected to outlive one of her sons much less
her daughter-in-law, was wheeled in by bath chair to join the company as
they sat round for the Pastor to lead their prayers and prompt the
direction of their silent contemplations. Then, Oma having fallen
asleep, was taken back to her room before the rest of the party set out
for the churchyard. The Pall Bearers hoisted Maria's casket onto their
shoulders and the Chief Mourner led the sedate procession the short
distance to where the grave had been opened ready to receive its
offering. Judging from the most unpleasant smell hanging over the
churchyard, the family vault had been penetrated allowing Maria to be
lowered into the ground to join the Bisdom-van-Vliet's who had
predeceased her. The Pastor led his congregation in the Lord's Prayer
before the funeral party turned to return to the house allowing the
gravediggers to cover the coffin with earth and seal in the smell of the
stinking rich. Before the family went their separate ways to resume
their daily lives marcellus laid before them a substantial meal
accompanied by plenty to drink in order to to sustain them for the start
of their journey.

Once Marcellus, Paulina and Johan has bade farewell to the rest of the
funeral party, a sense of emptiness and malaise afflicted each of them.
They shared the anti-climax at having no focus for their activities and
attention now that the event for which they had expended so much energy
in preparation was over. Now what should they do with themselves?
Marcellus would ordinarily have gone back to his work but desisted so as
to honour of the memory of his wife. Paulina was also thinking of what
she needed to do in order to catch up with the management of the house
and estates which had surely been neglected during her absence. Mostly,
though, she was pre-occupied with trying to make sense of the state that
Johan had got into. As for Johan, he sought to avoid for as long as
possible the inevitable questioning by his wife, ideally until his skin
had a chance to heal so that there was no outward sign to give force and
direction to her inquiries. He wanted to be alone with a few good,
Haastrecht cigars and a bottle or two of Marcellus's best Cognac.

After a period of desultry conversation all three agreed that they
should retire in order to begin the process of recovery from their
exertions with a period of uninterrupted rest and, hopefully, a good
night's sleep. Johan took his leave of father and daughter with an
almost unmannerly haste then shut himself up in his quarters in a way
that clearly signalled that he did not wish to be disturbed. Marcellus
and Paulina exchanged glances registering their surprise at Johan's
departure but they neither discussed nor commented on his motivation.
Instead, they spent a quiet half hour in reminiscing about Maria whilst
permitting themselves a few tears for the loss of her. Then, having
released the tensions of the day, they took their individual thoughts
off to bed.

\subsection{}

Maria was barely cold in her grave before the churchyard beside her was
disturbed in preparation for Oma's burial. Once again, the family
gathered in prayer and reflection at the house. Once again, they stood
in the churchyard to watch the small coffin containing Oma's shrivelled
and shrunken corpse being lowered into the foetid extension of the
family vault. Once again, they dined until replete before going their
separate ways. But this time there was no subsequent sense of a void
left by the person now gone. Instead, a sense of relief that was only be
tinged with sadness. At the age of 84, it had been Oma's time. The force
of the woman who had ruled the household in the wake of her husband's
untimely death, had continued to make her presence felt after
Marcellus's marriage brought another woman into the house and then gone
on to hold her own in the trio of mother, wife and daughter that
followed had long dissipated as she became increasingly frail and infirm
then, for the most part, confined to her room. They had gradually become
accustomed to her absence but not innured to the growing suffering from
which only death had the power to relieve her.

Another difference between Maria's funeral and Oma's came later in the
day when Paulina and Johan shared the same bed. Over the six weeks that
intervened between the two funerals Johan's skin had returned to its
normal condition, he had regained a healthy-looking physique and
regained the confidence to tackle the demands of marital intimacy, both
physical and otherwise. The odours about his person had returned to
their usual combination of cologne, cigars and cognac in various stages
of staleness, contributing to his person being generally more
approachable. Paulina had not quite recovered from the horror of the
realzation that the skin rash attributed to salt burns had, in fact,
covered all of his torso as well. She was astute enough to see that he
had been trying to pass it off as something far more trivial than it
actually was, and to form the view that only some contaigious disease
could have led him to keep her at arm's length for several weeks. His
complete recovery allowed her enough optimism to conclude that whatever
the illness had been, it was now a thing of the past. She could not
quite ignore the nagging recollection of that invoice from a strange
Rotterdam doctor and Johan never quite regained even the semblance of
his earlier interest in his wife.

In fact, nothing was ever be the same for the Bisdom van Vliet's after
Oma's death. Paulina and Johan would soon return to their home in Den
Haag leaving Marcellus to wander the empty rooms of the old familie huis
trying to escape the fact that he was now all alone there. Of course, it
was only right that Paulina should return to her own house, espeially
now that Johan seemed to have retrned from his duties at sea. Now that
there was no possibility of Maria ever returning, more permananet
arrangments had been put in place to cover her roles in managing house
and estates. A man of business had been engaged for the latter and
seemed to be keeping on top of things. Marcellus had also taken on a
housekeeper after interviewing many suitable women but rejecting them
all until he finally could find no possible grounds on which to continue
to deny that he needed the services of such a person. So far, these new
arrangements had been to his satisfaction. Not that he cared much for
his domestic comfort now that he was bereft of family, but that the
management of the lands and estates was no longer to be conducted at the
grace and favour of his daughter came unexpectedly as a relief.

Paulina was glad to be released from the heavy burdens of filling her
mother's shoes. She had plenty to manage on her own behalf now that her
mother's will had been enacted. Maria had bequeathed her five houses,
two warehouses, two farms, five orchards, a mill, a stable and meadow
and hay lands so she was a woman of property in her own right now,
although in a modest way compared to her father's property and lands.
She felt that she had neglected her friends over the past months and
wanted, neigh needed, to see them again to gain succour from their
amity. before they left Haastrecht she took the oppportunity to spend
some time first with Mientje Blanken, whom she considered to be her very
best friend, then with Helena and Cornelia Droost. Their sympathy with
her loss gave her much succour which itself helped her to put her
worries about Johan into some sort of perspective, although she did not
divulge any hint of her marital situation to her spinster friends.

All too soon, Paulina and Johan departed for Den Haag leaving Marcellus
feeling very alone in the rambling, old familie huis. In a matter of a
few months he had gone from feeling his life complicated by the presence
of three women in his home to missing their company and the civilising
touches a woman brought to the house. He wandered through the rooms now
devoid of human occupancy since even the servants kept away, there being
little for them to do most of the time, almost feeling a stranger in his
own home. It was as if the house no longer belonged to him and he began
to see it as an outsider might. The old rooms were now so outdated that
they could almost be museum exhibits. Even the new part of the house
seemed slightly shabby and old-fashioned as the sunlight through the
windows threw a spotlight onto every little scuff and stain. He took his
meals alone, as he had done many times recently, but now he knew there
was no Oma dozing in her room and no Maria to return to him from an
erand or visit. Only Paulina remained a possible companion. Whilst she
had been living back at home he had grown used to her companionship
despite her morose temperament. Now she had gone back to her life as a
married woman and some else's companion. He felt bereft.

His natural recourse in times of personal disquiet was to seek the
creative upslift he got from his work, from seeing a project through
from the first idea to the final product. Normal duties were a
distraction, yes, but now her needed more so he turned his attention to
his latest grand scheme - the pump house which would keep the polders of
Lopikerward drained. Marcellus had been working in partnership with
Lopik's burgermeester to apply a modern solution to the flooding
problems in this area caused by the conjunction of sinking peatlands and
rising river levels. The mills had been coping by pushing water into a
holding pond behind Haastrecht then discharging it into the Hollandse
IJssel through small locks into the harbour then onto the river. But the
mills now needed some help, especially when the wind did not blow to
turn their sails.

Marcellus had joined a party of dignitaries on a visit to the new
Cruquius pumping station, one of three that had been built to drain the
vast Haarlemermeer lake to the south west of Amsterdam. It had been a
truely inspirational visit, not least because the drainage was the first
project to be accomplished, not by the use of windmills at all, but
soley by the use of steam powered pumps. Quite a departure for Dutch
drainage engineers for which they had the English to thank with their
advanced steam technology. Once the lake had been enclosed by a
retaining dijk, the three pump houses had taken moved all the water out
into a ring canal in just a little over four years. A feat which, until
he saw The Hydraulic, as they called it, for himself, had seemed
impossible to Marcellus and made his own battles with flooding polder
seem puny in compariason.

AS the barge conveying the party approached Cruquius along the canal
their first impression was of a sort of castle but with the addition of
a tall chimney. The engineer leading the tour explained that the boilers
were housed in the hall which they could easily have mistaken for a
medieval great hall, whilst the pumps themselves occupied a crenelated
round tower beside it. However, the tower had eight great legs sticking
out evenly around it which moved up and down in a manner that was
disconcertingly like a vast spider on the move. Of course, the tower
stood still and these legs were, in fact, the driving beams and piston
links. The tour of the inside of the pumping station compounded the
impression of animus as the boilers and steam engines roared, hissed and
snorted. The amount of water that this working monster could move with
the combined efforts of the eight pistons would have beggared belief had
Marcellus not seen it with his own eyes. He found the whole experience
exhilarating to the verge of frightening. It did, however, open his eyes
to the power of steam which he now championed as the solution to the
local problems back at home.

He could not as single-mindedly apply steam engines to the drainage of
the troublesome polders of Lopikerward as the engineers of
Haarlemmermeer had for a number of reasons. Marcellus realized that his
own reluctance to abandon the use of windmills, which had been tried and
tested across the centuries, would be echoes by the people of the Vlist.
Replacing the mills for a new-fangled and alien mechanical contrivance
was a risk to great to be contemplated by the ordinary man. The workings
of the machinery would be unknown territory for them, alomost like a
magic trick moving the water around - or something biblical. They would
fear what they didn't undertsand rather than embrace it. The value of
steam pumping needed to be demonstrated in action so that it might
become commonplace and no longer a mystery. Although he had been assured
of the reliabilty of these engines, what if the machine did break down?
He would need to find at least one local man who would be willing to
learn not only how to operate the engine but also how to maintain and,
if necessary, repair it. Meanwhile, the current mill workers should be
reassured that they were not about to be deprived of their livelihoods
and homes in short order. There had been many reports of workers
dispalced by machinery seeking terrible revenge on their masters and
their infernal engines. The change to steam needed to be accomplished
gradually and the support of the millers courted along the way.

But now, in his bereavement, Marcellus threw his engeries into the
Haastrecht steam pump project. He haunted the architects of the
buildings which would house the pump and the man who would operate it.
The pump itself was being made in Cornwall and he contemplated paying a
visit to the engineering company there but, in the end, decided that it
was too long a journey to make and would necessitate too long an absence
from home so reluctantly abandoned the idea. Maps and calculations
absorbed him as he went over the plan and the predicted benefits that it
would deliver. He kept upwith his business and political interests yet
the new drainage system was there to fill the void left by the absence
of his three women.

He was also prone to distracting himself with pondering the state of his
daughter's marriage which he could easily have worked himself up into a
state of worry over. She seemed unable to settle down to life in Den
Haag despite her husband being home from his wanderings permanently, or
so it would seem. Paulina seemed to be busying herself with social
activities which her husband seemed not to share in. Marcellus found
that he was none too keen on Johan, although he was hard pressed to put
his finger on quite why this should be. The chap seemed friendly enough
but there was something a bit off kilter about him. A recently received
letter had brought this feeling of unease to the front of Marecllus's
mind as it seemed to typify something vaguely distasteful about the man.

For a start, Johan had addressed him as "Valued Papa" which seemed a
little too familiar to Marcellus. Although Johan had lost his own father
when just a boy and perhaps had a need for a father figure even now he
had grown to a man approaching middle years, Marcellus felt
uncomfortable at being thrust into his shoes. The text itself began with
some talk of business in the form of the mortgage value of a polder near
Middleburg, the ledgers relating to Hilletje and some matters concerning
wills which left Marcellus wondering why he needed to know all this.
What was of more interest was a passage reporting the couple's good
health and the curtailing of their pleasure in Den Haag and Scheveningen
by the inclement weather. It seemed that Paulina's friend, Jenny van
Zijll, was visiting them but due to leave imminently. Johan said no more
about her visit. More appositely, he made no concession to Marcellus's
situation as doubly bereaved. In fact, Marcellus found it in rather
poortaste that Johan went on to end his letter with ab extensive account
of Utrecht gossip concerning a man marrying a beautiful girl 35 years
his junior ( was that a hint to Marcellus to followsuit) and a couple
who wed againts the wishes of her family which ended with the jilted
groom trying to drown himself by jumping from the Hoornbrug (gain in bad
taste considering Marcellus's own losses). Somehow Marcellus felt that
the final salutation from "Your loving son" was rather overblown.
However was his daughter faring in a marriage with someone so lacking in
sensitivity to others and so keen to inflate his emotional connections
to them?

\section{Summer 1872(3)}

\subsection{}

The arrival of Theodorus Hooft caused something of a stir amongst the
inhabitants of Haastrecht. There had, of course, been rumours that a new
family had taken a house just beyond the sluis which could be
interpreted as indicating that they are clearly not patrician or even
simply wealthy. On the other hand, they were not simple folk who tended
to live even further out along the dyke in dwellings which could only be
described as basic or even hovels. The labouring population was almost
entirely made up of folk born and raised in the village or who had
married into these local families, but the Hoofts were clearly incomers,
thus of great concern. The consensus among the watchers had to be that
newcomers fell somewhere in between the Bisdom van Vliets and the common
folk, likely the man of the family would be some sort of tradesman.

Grist to the rumour mill came from the Straver family of carpenters who
had let it be known that they had been approached by 'building interests
in Den Haag' with a view to engaging one of them in a 'grand and
important' local construction project. Details of the Den Haag end of
things were few and far between, the Straver family being more exercised
with spreading it about that young Cornelis Straver, at the age of only
18, was to be given the honour of being a senior journeyman on this
project. Details of the who, what, when and where of the putative
construction remained the subject of much inventive conjecture. Thus, as
soon as a stranger, accompanied by a woman and child, came into view on
the dyke top word soon spread and people materialised at every vantage
point to inspect the newcomers and their cart load of possessions as
they steadily made their way towards their new home.

As soon as the cart had come to a reliable halt, Theodorus stepped down
and and raised his arms to help his wife safely down to earth, an
especially delicate task since, as all could plainly see, she was
pregnant. Next came a boy of about four who seemed less than keen to
explore his new home, clinging to his mother's skirt thumb in mouth.
Having secured his horse, the carter made haste to uncover his cargo and
carry a chair into the house in order that Mevrouw Hooft might sit and
recover after their long, uncomfortable journey from Den Haag. A box of
toys followed in the hope that the young boy might be entertained and
not get in the way of the men as they unloaded the rest of the family's
goods. This latter task was arguably facilitated by the many volunteers
from amongst the curious crowd who would later benefit in the way of
kudos, taking material form as free food and drink, when disseminating
their accounts of the family and their things in every detail.

At last, Theodorus paid the carter and closed the front door on the
intrusive helpers who had been reluctant to leave. It had been a long
day indeed! Maria Francina had wanted to supervise the unloading of
their kitchen equipment, linens and clothing but he had been quite stern
about making her stay sitting down. Hendrik Willem had been fractious
and clung to his mother and attempted to do the same to his father,
which was rather less than convenient He had more than enough to cope
with managing the location of every unloaded item, especially when
people were crowding into the small house carrying anything they could
lay their hands and requiring Theodorus to be in several places at once.
He was, frankly, exhausted but the day was not over yet as he needed to
make a site visit to check on progress and make his presence felt among
the labourers. It was a considerable relief to him when a thoughtful
gesture by \emph{Burgemeester} Bisdom van Vliet materialised in the
shape of two maids who stepped into the middle of the chaos and set
about making up beds and organising basic kitchen and toileting
facilities.

\subsection{}

Paulina had never felt so perturbed in all her life, not even when she
met Johan Jacob. Her uncommon disquiet was compounded by the sensation
that she was about to be overwhelmed and suffer an uncharacteristic and
disgraceful public emotional collapse. She desperately cast about for
some sort of refuge from being exposed to social humiliation. Although
she would have preferred solitude, nevertheless she was so glad to see
her friend, Cornelia Droost, making haste in her direction. Allowing
herself to be guided by Cornelia's hand under her elbow, Paulina entered
the cool, calm quiet of the Droost house where she was passed into the
enveloping wings of a plush armchair. Tea was ordered and Helena sent
for.

As the disturbance of her arrival died down, the Droost house tried to
regain its usual deep silence only punctuated only by the ponderous tick
of the long case clock in the hall. But not today and a miserable
Paulina realized that she could still hear the commotion outside from
which she so badly wanted to escape. Granted, the clamour of destruction
was now muted by the fabrics and furnishings of the house, yet the
sounds of wrecking that filtered through retained the power to unsettle
her spirit. It was incomprehensible yet it manifestly true that the home
she had grown up in, which had seemed so solid, secure, immutable even,
was being reduced to unrecognisable chunks of stone and wood accompanied
by clouds of dust. Oh, so much commotion and chaos! Horrified, she could
feel herself about to swoon in front of other people, even if they were
her oldest and best friends.

When her father had first put forward his scheme to demolish the old
\emph{familie huis} his idea was clearly a bold one but, the way he
presented it, seemed to make sense. His vision was to replace the
existing arbitrary assemblage of buildings with a single, modern and
stylish property. Part of his argument was that the old house was
woefully lacking in domestic comforts and innovations, yet this was true
of so many properties built by 17th century patricians. Many wealthy
families had stuck to the Dutch way and periodically made additions and
adaptations to their old houses thus giving them a new lease of life. It
was obvious to Paulina and others that something more than replacing an
old house, which was not exactly falling into ruins, was at work here.
Marcellus's next point was incontestable. A new house was the way he
wished to mark the anniversary of his fifty years as
\emph{burgermeester} of Haastrecht, which was undoubtedly a momentous
achievement worthy of some grand gesture. But knocking down buildings
which could have been the basis for a perfectly good house then to
replace them with a completely new one? The family were puzzled and
dismayed, although they attempted to hide this from the proud and elated
Marcellus.

With the utmost secrecy, Marcellus had set about finding an architect
who was familiar with the new style of houses currently the fashion in
Den Haag. He wanted something that had the same character as Paulina and
Johan's new house, on the subject of which he had surreptitiously
quizzed the couple and received glowing reports. The architect paid a
site visit to Haastrecht early in 1972 which resulted in the advice to
build the new house on the footprint of the old one. This strategy would
avoid the trouble and expense of putting in new wooden piles for the
foundations since the existing ones were still in good condition. It
also had the virtue of keeping to the size of the original plot thus
obviating the need to negotiate ownership of more land from adjacent
properties. With his brief clearly established, the architect soon had a
set of plans for the new Bisdom van Vliet house available for the
perusal of his client.

Marcellus was delighted with the look of his new house so set about
finding suitable master craftsmen to build it. He preferred to use local
men where at all possible, but the architect championed a talented young
mason and plasterer, Theodorus Hooft, who had experience in the modern
building techniques currently in demand in Den Haag. Marcellus was
impressed by Heer Hooft when they met, finding him amiable yet polite.
They were soon collaborating effortlessly in making a refinements to the
original plans so as to better fulfil Marcellus's aspirations. The young
man was also willing to uproot his wife and young son from their home in
Den Haag and move the family to Haastrecht in order to be near his
client and his place of work.

Then came the day when Marcellus, Heer Hooft at his side, called
together family and friends for a somewhat theatrical unveiling of his
radical project. He was so delighted with himself and his vision of the
future that nobody had the courage to challenge his decision, and Heer
Hooft seemed such a nice young man who had clearly committed so much to
the project and worked so hard on behalf of his client. In short, the
two men put up a united and unassailable front.

Once the cat was out of the bag the gossips got to work. In parlours and
kitchens all over the Province of South Holland the mention of Marcellus
was heard to provoke phrases such as:

"\emph{Hier kan je je ei kwijt ...}"

as a ringleader would invite those around them to openly share their
opinions on Marcellus's grand plan and "loose their egg here", allegedly
in private.

Then someone would venture that,

"\emph{Hij heeft een klap van de molen beet!}" or "\emph{Een klap van de
molen gehad hebben!}"

to convey the view that he was not acting very wisely as though he had
been "hit by one of the sails on the windmill" and has lost his mind as
a result of it.

In his defense would come the reply,

"\emph{Leder kaasje heeft zijn gaatje!}"

to caution that "every cheese has its hole" so nobody's perfect.

The dismayed would retort,

"\emph{Als de herder verdwaalt dolen the schapen.}"

"If the shepherd gets lost the sheep just wander around." In other
words, if the leader goes off in a wrong direction then other people
don't quite know what to do.

Or,

"\emph{Nu breekt mijn klomp!}"

"Now my clog is breaking!" I am totally amazed and I certainly didn't
expect that!.

More colourfully,

\emph{"In de nesten zitten of werken!}"

"He is sitting on a nest!" A country expression referring to the
important task that millers have in keeping the area where the top
rollers are free of birds nests. If birds get in there and build their
nests then the rollers to turn the cap of the windmill jam resulting in
a complete mess. So, the more thoughtful gossips have realized that
Marcellus finds himself confused and not quite knowing what to do.

The less kindly, or more jealous, counter that,

"\emph{op grote voet leven!}"

He is wealthy, or "living on a big foot", so can afford to spend a lot
of money on whatever he wants,including a new house.

Those who envy his social position chip in with,

"\emph{Hij laat de wereld op zijn duim draaien!}"

"He lets the world spin on his thumb", implying that he has too much
power!

Countered by,

"\emph{Je wordt geleefd!}"

"He is being lived by life" rather than living life and is so busy that
his life is out of control.

"\emph{Hij heeft het zo druk als de kippen voor Pasen!}"

"He is as busy as the chickens before Easter!"

One thing all agree on is that,

"\emph{Hij staat vast in zijn schoenen.}"

"He stands firmly in his shoes" so he knows his own mind and stands his
ground.

Inevitably the village chatter reached Paulina, who came to appreciate
that the general view was that her father has upset people by not doing
what they expected him to do. Whilst some shared her own thought that
his recent personal losses and his hectic work schedule had clouded his
judgement, all acknowledged that it had to be accepted that a man as
wealthy, powerful and sure of himself as her father was not likely to
question his chosen course of action or examine the reasons for it. Nor,
she would add, is he likely to consider the impact on his daughter of
seeing her childhood home razed to the ground.

So,once she had grasped it, the opportunity that the Droost sisters
provided of being able to unburden herself to good and trusted friends
afforded Paulina some much needed relief from her private distress. But
then she heard something which cast a new light on the situation and
upset her once again. Helena and Cornelia, feeling that they may also
speak freely to their friend, offered an additional insight concerning
Marcellus's motivation behind the new house. By overhearing the talk
around the building site, they had come to the view that Marcellus hopes
to lure Paulina back to live with him permanently by building her a
house in the style to which he fancies she has become accustomed in Den
Haag. In addition, it seems that he hopes that such a grand property,
coupled with the rise in status through association with himself, might
overcome any reluctance on Johan's part to settle in Haastrecht. His
strategy seems aimed at removing any conflict his daughter might feel
between her duties to her husband and to her father by locating both men
in the same place.

Paulina was astounded by this perspective on matters. Her father had
been astute only in so far as he recognised how torn she was between her
life in Den Haag and her ties to her former home, however much she had
hoped to conceal this from him. Since her mother's death she has felt
the burden of management of the family's fall entirely onto her
shoulders whether she wanted this or not. It would not be easy to find
someone else to assist her father in matters which were second nature to
her after a lifetime of involvement in the Bisdom van Vliet estate.
There would be a lot for an incomer to get to grips with, not to mention
the time it would take her to initiate them into the ways things should
be done. Then there was the question of security and being able to trust
an outsider with matters of business and politics which they would not
wish broadcast. Perhaps her father had everyone's best interests at
heart after all, but did it have to involve so much destruction!

Paulina was distracted from her bewilderment and distress by a sudden
outburst of excitement from Cornelia who had been punctuating their
discussion with trips to peek around the lace curtain at the big bay
window to their first floor salon from which vantage point she could
look down into the street.

"Oh, Paulina! Have you met Heer Hooft yet That's him outside now! Isn't
he handsome! Oh, Paulina, do let's go down so that you can introduce us
all. If you make as if to leave our house it would seem quite natural!"

Clearly Cornelia had been smitten by the builder! Feeling that no good
could come of encouraging her friend in yearning after a married man of
unknown provenance and unsuitable social standing, Paulina made the
quite legitimate excuse of not feeling up to such a demanding social
encounter and wishing remain quietly where she was for a while longer.
Besides, the three women still had many snippets of news to share and
mull over.

\subsection{}

At last the clamour outside seemed to have died down to a tolerable
level as the working day came to an end. Paulina rose and bade her
grateful farewells to the Droost sisters before availing herself of the
opportunity to venture outside again in relative calm. She was to join
her father for dinner with their Pastor who had insisted that the
temporarily homeless Marcellus lodge in the first floor corner room of
his Kerkstraat \emph{pastorie}. The two men were lifelong friends and
very easy in each other's company so Paulina was looking forward to a
relaxed visit and, since the weather was fine, enjoying the short stroll
on the way there.

Her mind on the pleasures to come, Paulina failed to notice the man
about to cross her path so was brought back to the present with a jolt
when Heer Hooft slowed to a halt in order to avoid a collision. He
raised his hat to her with the clear intention of doing more than just
politely greeting her before resuming his journey. Indeed, he made plain
that he knew who she was and begged her indulgence as he introduced
himself. It seems that he had noticed her visit to the building site
earlier on and how distressed she had been by what she had found taking
place there. He graciously expressed his concern for her and enquired as
to how she now fared. She sensed his empathy with her feelings at seeing
her family home and all its memories and associations reduced to a pile
of ugly and useless rubble.

Now having the opportunity to take him in, Paulina found that he was,
indeed, a handsome man who was surprisingly young-looking to hold such a
responsible position. He told her that he had just moved his household
to Haastrecht from Den Haag so as to be more closely involved with her
father's project. Paulina enquired after his family and discovered that
he had a son, Hendrik Willem, who was approaching his fourth birthday
and that his wife was expecting their second child in a month or so.
Paulina remarked that she had moved in the opposite direction, leaving
Haastrecht for Den Haag upon her marriage a few years earlier. She found
him easy company and that their encounter was not the socially strained
affair that their difference in standing had led her to anticipate. So,
their first conversation came to a well-orchestrated and amicable
closure with both going their separate ways having made positive
comments on the almost certainty of their meeting again. As they parted,
she caught out of the corner of her eye the twitch of a lace curtain at
the Droost first floor window!

From another first floor window, her father had been watching for her
arrival so was waiting on the steps of the pastor's house before Paulina
had reached the door. He greeted her enthusiastically before sweeping
her inside to be taken under the wing of the pastor in his salon where
his wife was waiting to serve refreshments to the small party. Marcellus
was keen to hear Paulina's impression of the work on his new house but
Paulina didn't have the heart to tell him how awful she had found the
whole thing. Her father was more animated than she had seen him for a
long time and looked in good health. Clearly the new venture had given
him a fillip, whatever she might be feeling about it.

As her visit progressed, Paulina came to understand that her father's
rejuvenation was at least partly the result of the good food and
congenial company he was enjoying at the pastor's house. The temporary
hiatus in his own domestic affairs, since there now was no household,
had also lifted some of the burden he usually carried. Paulina felt a
rush of guilt as she realised that her father had been starting to fade
away and it would not have been long before his health began to suffer.
On top of the revelation that the new house was, in no small part,
designed to lure her back to Haastrecht, she suddenly saw how much her
father needed her. By contrast, she had to admit to herself, however,
painfully, that Johan only came alive when he was away from home.
Indeed, he seemed to shrink into himself when confined to the routine
behaviours expected of a man of his social standing. She had much to
think about on her carriage journey back home.

\subsection{}

Paulina was next in Haastrecht when her presence was requested at a
meeting between her father and Theodorus Hooft. By this time the roof of
the old house about to be removed. The tiles would be sorted and neatly
stacked ready for re-use on other buildings in the area, discarding any
that were too fragile or already broken. The money from the sale of the
old tiles would go at least a little way towards offsetting the cost of
the new roofing materials. By the same token, the wood from the
supporting timbers would be kept for building purposes if it was sound,
or cut for firewood if it was rotten, wormy or damaged in removal.

Theodorus had a gentle soul in spite of the tough exterior required to
do his job. This was why he had wanted his clients to see the old house
whilst it still resembled a habitable dwelling, conscious of the
associations it would have accrued through a lifetime of memories. He
understood the form of grief that was in store for them. Once the roof
had been taken away, the next stage in demolition would be removal of
the ceilings, at which point the interior would be open to the elements.
The rooms where the routines of daily life and the outstanding
significant events of their times had taken place would be crudely
exposed to public view. Prying eyes would make gossip over the rain
sodden wood, plaster, paper and fitments that once graced the public and
private chambers of the Burgermeester's family. For the two remaining
members of that family, the shell of their home would be shorn of all
their human activity. The old house would be dead and lost to them
forever. Just simple lumps of material on a building site, as it already
was for him.

"I respectfully requested that you join me here today because I have had
an idea which I wanted to put to. I realise that this destructive phase
of the new house project is very hard for you both. So, I have been
entertaining a notion which might make the wrench with the past a little
easier. Perhaps if we could carry forward something of the old house to
incorporate into the new one then you would be comforted by a sense of
continuity."

He paused in order to gauge how his idea was being received. Encouraged
by their apparent openness to his proposal, Theodorus continued,

"I wondered if there might be some discrete, structural part of the
interior which hold special meaning for you and which would be suitable
for relocation. If you can bear it, take a look around inside whilst it
is still safe to do so. You might bid farewell to each room whilst
having in mind the selection one fixture, such as door and frame or
fireplace, in the old house which you would like me to transplant into
your new home. Take care to choose something you both like and gives you
pleasant feelings just to look at it. But also bear in mind that I need
to be able to ensure that it can be removed intact and that we can find
a place for it in the new design where it will look natural. If you
approve, I will leave you to look around by yourselves but will be on
hand should you need me and when you are ready to discuss your choice."

With that, Theodorus bowed politely then withdrew to continue his
supervision of his workmen. Out of the corner of his eye he saw his
clients regard each other for a long moment then exchange a few words
before the Burgermeester gave a quick, decisive nod and they turned
towards the open door and slowly made their way inside the house that
was no longer their home.

He has expected it to take them a considerable length of time to tour
the property and reach a decision so was taken by surprise when, barely
fifteen minutes later, he noticed one of his men hurrying in his
direction with a message from the Burgemeester requesting his
attendance. He located his client and Mevrouwe le Fevre de Montigny by
almost bowling them over as he entered the lage huis voorkamer. Both
were calmly contemplating a large section of wooden screening which
incorporated two doorways and a number of etched glass panels. It was
rather larger than Theodorus had foreseen but he could see the
attraction as it was both decorative and functional with the benefit
that it met his needs as a builder. It was an easy assumption that the
screen held some significance for his clients since they had agreed upon
it so rapidly. So, before matters went any further he needed to make a
detailed inspection to make sure that this quite delicate installation
could be removed without peril and that it was sound in itself. The last
thing any of them would want would be to introduce a pest, such as
woodworm, into a brand new building. However, on the face of it, they
had made an excellent choice. So much so that he wondered why he hadn't
spotted its potential himself!

Bidding farewell to his clients with the promise of letting them know
his verdict next day, Theodorus set about his inspection but not before
he had instructed his men to make haste to remove the roof since the
upper floors were not involved in the preservation of the screen.
Although his initial impression of the soundness of the piece was
favourable, he had a secondary motivation in taking time to reach a
final decision. He wanted to test out the local man appointed as his
second in command.,Cornelis Straver. Cornelis came from a long line of
timmermen, carpenters, by trade from a well respected village family and
was assumed to have some expertise to bring to the matter at hand.
However, he was only nineteen years old and had never been involved in a
big project before. Theodorus wanted to take the opportunity to test
Cornelis out and, all being well, begin to forge good working elations
with him.

\subsection{}

Cornelis was employed on the carving of a sturdy, oak door for one of
the high street houses when the messenger from Heer Hooft reached him.
He wasn't due to begin work on the Bisdom van Vliet new house until
construction started and wondered why he had been called upon now. His
father looked up from his work and, with a slight smile, nodded that it
was alright for Cornelis to leave the job he was doing, saying,

"Go! But best clean yourself up a bit first!"

All the family knew that it was important that Cornelis make a good
first impression on Heer Hooft. He put away his tools in their proper
places in the workshop, as was the disciplined habit of his trade, then
crossed the yard and went into the family's cottage. In the kitchen he
took one of the buckets of water his mother had lined up after she had
filled them at the river that morning. He filled a basin at the sink,
removed his shirt and splashed himself in the cold water down to his
waist, drying himself off on the discarded shirt. His mother had fetched
him a clean shirt and a comb for his hair.

Aware that it would have been easy for the young carpenter to be
overawed by a man old enough to be his father as well as well versed in
the construction of Haagse style houses, his mother sought to calm his
nerves before this sudden and unexpected meeting. As she fussed round
him she reminded him that,

"Your father never had much regard for plasterers, it being an inferior
trade to ours. And you know what they say about Haagenars? All show and
no substance."

"Oh, mother! I'll be alright! After all, he's just a man like any
other!"

With that, he headed back outside, collected his satchel of basic tools
from its peg in the workshop, slung it across his body and set off to
see what Heer Hooft wanted. Arriving at the site, he was directed into
the Lage Huis where he found Heer Hooft examining a painted and glazed
screen. Cornelis removed his hat, stuffing it in his bag, before taking
the hand stretched out towards him. After exchanging pleasantries,
Cornelis remembering to congratulate his senior on the recent birth of
his daughter and been assured that mother and baby were thriving, they
got down to the matter at hand.

Cornelis understood that his carpenter's knowledge to be applied to
forming a judgement as to the viability of removing the screen intact
with a view to using it in the new house. Both men applied themselves to
a close scrutiny of the state of the wood, Cornelis begging leave to
scratch away the paint in places in order to be assured of the integrity
of the raw wood concealed beneath. Having concluded their survey, both
agreed that there were no signs of infestation on rot which would
preclude the introduction of the screen into a new construction.

Next, Cornelis investigated the means by which the screen had been
inserted into its current position. After a while, he turned to Heer
Hooft with a question in mind,

"Do I understand correctly that this building is to be otherwise
demolished?"

Receiving an answer in the affirmative, he continued,

"This screen is an original dating back to the time of King Louis XV of
France and was put in place when the Lage Huis was built by Theodorus
Bisdom in the middle of the 18th Century. This means that the screen is
a classical piece and the it is important to preserve it if at all
possible In addition, as you probably know, Burgermeester Theodorus
Bisdom used his wealth to expand the family home and acquire the Slot
van Vliet and surrounding lands. It was his investment that gave the
Bisdom van Vliet's their full name as well as establishing them as
important patriarchs. So, screen is a reminder of the rise of the family
so not only an good choice for what it is in itself but also what it
means to the current family members."

Heer Hooft expressed his surprise at the significance of what he heard
and complimented Cornelis on his knowledgeableness. Cornelis returned to
the thrust of his original question,

" The only way such a delicate and old piece can be safely removed is by
careful removal of its surrounding structures. In other words, it will
need painstaking excavation rather than the usual level of care applied
to demolition work."

Heer Hooft acknowledged what he was being told and that it would mean
slow, painstaking and, of course, expensive work the cost of which would
need to be put to Burgemeester Bisdom van Vliet in balance to the
significance of the screen. Cornelis had proved his worth and impressed
his senior with his confidence and maturity during their first working
encounter. This encouraged Heer Hooft to further include Cornelis in the
next phase of the screen project, namely where, and how, in the design
of the new house the screen could be put to use. In order to further
this discussion, he conducted Cornelis to his makeshift office where the
plans for the new house were unrolled onto a large, plain wood table,
the corners weighted down with fragments of complex plasterwork.

Both men poured over the ground floor plan, each suggesting
possibilities but rejecting them all. Cornelis was concerned that there
should be no structural load on the delicate, if not quite fragile,
screen and Heer Hooft raising matters of the utility of the public
rooms, possible privacy issues and the undeniable fact that they just
did not fit with the modern architectural style. Cornelis found it
increasingly easy to voice his thoughts as they occurred to him and that
he could accept the older man's sometimes opposing views without feeling
diminished. In short, the two men seemed to have got off on a sound
footing.

Turning to the plan of the upper floor, there developed an optimistic
atmosphere. The architect had divided the floor into two, separate
appartments: one for Burgermeester Bisdom van Vliet and another for his
daughter and her husband. So, whilst the public rooms were shared, there
were private quarters upstairs for the two generations of Bisdom van
Vliet. Since each apartment had a separate entrance from the spacious
area at the top of the main staircase, they came to the resolution of
dividing the screen so that part formed the entrance to one apartment
and the rest the entrance to the other.

Now Cornelis needed to look at how the screen might be divided whilst
Heer Hooft persuaded the architect to alter his plans. The latter proved
easier than anticipated since the architect had harboured some
uneasiness about the upper hall, worried that it was too dark. The only
natural light in his plans came from a window at the head of the stairs
which, although the same large expanse of glass as all the other
windows, was really not enough to penetrate the centrally located space
of the upper hall. The glazed and white painted panels he was being
asked to incorporate into his design suddenly prompted a radical change
of perspective. The theme of light paint and maximum glazing could be
the answer to lighting up the whole area!

\section{Summer 1876}

\subsection{}

Theodorus and Cornelis were going at each other hammer and tongues,
oblivious to the audience they were attracting. The new batch of workmen
who had been taken on in an effort to speed things up were looking on
with some anxiety, somehow intuiting that they were the focus of the
disagreement and hoping that it was not going to lead to their dismissal
with the consequent return to poverty and idleness. The old hands,
however, just shrugged and rolled their eyes, barely pausing in their
work. The tension between the two bosses had been building for some time
culminating in a storm that would blow itself out before the end of the
day. No need to worry, they advised the new men, just get on with your
tasks.

It was, indeed, the arrival of the gang of new workers which had been
the catalyst for the rather public venting of anger by the two
overseers. They and their attendant problems were not the direct cause
but consequent upon the approaching deadline for completion of the house
which had been imposed by the \emph{burgermeester}. Marcellus Bisdom van
Vliet had his heart, and his \emph{gilders}, set on being able to
celebrate his 50 year anniversary as \emph{Burgermeester} of Haastrecht
from the new house which had been commissioned specially for this
occasion. The whole village had involved themselves in grand plans to
honour him, suddenly making concrete the date by which the house should
be finished.

August 23rd - and there was such a lot left to do!

Much had been accomplished so far. Once the old house had been raised to
its foundations, these had needed strengthening with new brickwork onto
which the heavy timbers for the floor joists had been laid. Once the
shell of the house had been built using thousands upon thousands of
bricks it was time for the hard work of lifting and fitting the roof
beams and trusses. The complex structure and area of the upper floor of
the house made for a cats cradle of necessary wooden supporting
structure which would be strong enough to take the Fries flat pan tiles
of the roof. Meanwhile windows and doors were created and installed so
that the building was weather proof and the interior work could begin.

All of the heavy construction materials had to be brought along the
river by barge. The craft were sized to fit the confines of the
waterways they operated on and were each crewed by a single family who
lived on board. To maximize cargo space the living quarters were
squeezed into the stern with cooking, eating, washing and sleeping all
vying for space. Boards laid across the space served as beds and had to
be taken away before the day's domestic activities could begin. Families
with many children crowded together so disease was rife, as was
malnutrition as parents struggled to fill mouths on their meagre income.
Yet more babies easily came along but many died before they were old
enough to walk. It had not been unusual to see the wife harnessed to a
line ashore pulling the laden barge whilst her husband, worn out by the
effort of lading and unloading cargo, stayed on board and steered from
the tiller at the stern. Wind and current were not always favourable to
these folk and horse power often beyond their means. These were
weatherbeaten and hard-muscled folk, old before their time with lives
often prematurely ended by illnesses which the doctors were too busy to
diagnose or treat, scrawling the word "exhaustion" when registering
their death.

At least the carters who then brought the finer timber for interior work
and all the necessaries for plasterwork and decorative finishes could go
home to a roof over their heads, however mean a hovel they called home.
They worked their horses hard but Paulina, who had a strong interest in
matter equine, made sure that the animals were not ill treated or
underfed. Some said that she showed more care for the welfare of the
horses than their handlers.

Since Theodorus could not manage the building work and do the
plasterwork himself, he had engaged FPC Schild to undertake the massive
amount of skilled work in plastering the ceilings and all the decorative
plasterwork of the interior. Herein lay the source of the argument
between Theodorus and Cornelis. The plasterwork was falling behind
schedule because other work, which needed to be done first, had not been
completed. Hence the influx of new workers. However, both Theodorus and
Cornelis had laid claim to these men and set them on competing tasks.
Given the tense atmosphere created by time pressure, it was perhaps
understandable that the conflict erupted into an angry exchange. Once
some steam had been let off, both men were able to regain their usual
level headedness and their usually excellent working relationship was
able to reassert itself so that the next time men looked in their
direction they saw the tow men briefly embracing each other then shaking
hands with smiles on their faces.

\subsection{}

Theodrus and Cornelis shut themselves up in the makeshift office and let
it be known that they were only to be disturbed in case of dire
emergency. Any knocks on the door or timid calls were ignored. Their
agreed strategy was to take an imaginary walk through the house,
compiling lists of unfinished work in each room as they went. They also
had a draft of the plans for the day of Marcellus's 50th anniversaryas
burgermeester celebrations.

The obvious place to start was with the ingang/entrance and vestibule
which it led into. Placed in the centre of the the six bays on the
ground floor, the large, sturdy wooden door was already in place.
Although it opened as a single door, a central column decorated with
vines and grapes gave the impression of double doors. Symmetrical panels
were glazed and decorated with wrought ironwork. Above and below each
inset glass were carved panels, oblong below and circular bosses topped
with semi-circular arches above. The rich colour of the wood and the
multi-faceted carving were pleasing to the eye and the whole was sturdy
and clearly designed to offer protection to the valuable contents which
would eventually be contained within. Cornelis was proud of it and
Theodorus thought this was rightly so.

But, they couldn't linger in admiration as there was a long way to go
and both agreed that the impressive entry needed no improvement. Once
inside the door. An entrance hall led up to the doorway into the inner
hall or gang at the end with a door leading off either side to a small
salon on the left and a reception area on the right. In order to create
symmetry, two false doors, one either side, had been created with a
central bay of plasterwork between them. Since this was the first
impression visitors, not to mention Marcellus, would have it needed to
show how important and wealthy the occupants of the house were. The
decoration of the vestibule was, therefore, designed to provide an
opulent impression but only as a backdrop for the displays of valuable
items and family crests destined to be placed there. So, whilst the
ceiling rose, cornicing and the headers above the doors involved complex
plaster mouldings which had been delicately painted in muted creams, the
central panels were relatively plain with a touch of blue in places to
set off the blue of the Chinese plates destined to be hung nearby. A
marble floor provided the finishing touch to this relatively small but
hugely important space.

The first room off the vestibule was the speekkamer or reception room.
This would be where the maid who answered the door would take visitors
to wait whilst she conveyed messages to and fro the occupants of the
house. Tradespeople would wait here to be paid and more important
callers to be admitted to the grote salon through the far door. A
relatively plain room, then. Even so, it was yet to be finished as the
expensive red flock wallpaper from England, chosen as a foil for the
gilt framed paintings destined to be displayed against it, remained to
be hung. Again, concerns about keeping the decoration clean came to the
surface as flock wallpaper was notorious for attracting dirt. Since the
guests admitted to the house for Marcellus's celebration were by
invitation only, it was agreed that the completion of this room could be
assigned a low priority.

The same could not be said of the kleine salon through the second door
off the vestibule. This was where Marcellus planned greet his guests and
provide refreshments.

Again, all the work had been done but the challenge was to keep it in
pristine condition despite the mess being created by work in progress in
the rest of the house. Use of the front door had been banned with
everything and everyone coming in through the kitchen and garden room
entrances. The doorway at the end of the vestibule marked the transition
from the public to the private areas of the house and, to mark the
importance of this, had been built to double thickness to accommodate
two doors,one after the other. To create a further barrier, provision
had been made for a heavy curtain to span the width of the wall at the
end of the vestibule. A temporary curtain had been hung here then both
doors closed with the door on the family side sealed.
