  <title>Prologue</title>

  <section>
    <title/>
    <para>The curator adjusted the head torch then began warming the short,
    thin-bladed knife over the spirit burner which was placed diagonally
    across the table from her. Satisfied that the sliver of steel was warm
    enough to do its job yet not so hot as to cause melting, she carefully
    worked it between the embossed disk of dark red wax and the paper beneath
    it. The seal had also been applied on top of a silk cord from which it
    took some careful working of the blade to remove but finally it came away
    intact to be laid aside with a frisson of relief that no damage had been
    done during its removal. Her mission was to reveal the contents of the
    artifact with a view to re-assembling the parts into the exact form in
    which the whole had been created over a century earlier. This was no easy
    task since the packet, which was about the size of modern paperback, had
    been thoroughly secured so as to evidence even the slightest attempt at
    tampering.</para>

    <para>A second seal was slowly and painstakingly removed, allowing the
    length of silk cord which had parcelled up the packet to be gently eased
    off. The cord, still dutifully trying to hold its shape, was placed to the
    left of the table. Soon all of the five seals that had been applied to the
    the enveloping sheet of paper were removed and set down beside the cord.
    The time had come to open the outer wrapper and take the first glimpse of
    what lay beneath.</para>

    <para>The packet had spent the day in a sealed box with the vapours of a
    seven parts alcohol to one part water mixture. This should have worked on
    the white glue, which owed its adhesive properties to the protein colloid
    processed from the bones of animals and fish, degrading it so as to allow
    the top triangle of fine wove paper to be lifted easily. It was not to be,
    however, and the edges of the flap needed delicate dabbing with a small
    sponge held by tweezers and dampened with some of the alcohol and water
    mix that had been warmed a little. Perhaps impatience got the better of
    the curator as she took up the slender knife once more for her first
    attempt at working the knife beneath the flap because the blade snagged,
    almost tearing the paper.</para>

    <para>The select group of museum friends who had been invited to attend
    this special event and who had been unconsciously leaning ever further
    forward as the curator did her work now drew in their breath as one. Each
    now became suddenly self-conscious, their rapt attention broken, and they
    began exchanging meaningful looks. For all that they tried to keen aura of
    a discrete distance and a reverend hush, their presence had now intruded
    and broken the curator's concentration. She leaned back in her chair,
    removed the irksome head torch and massaged her forehead. Accustomed to
    the intense torchlight, the candlelit room now seemed dim. Perhaps this
    was just as well as it helped to maintain a professional distance from the
    audience.</para>

    <para>The meticulous preparations for tonight's event had begun some hours
    earlier. A blanket was spread over the polished wood of the dinning room
    table then covered with a clean, white, cotton cloth. A single,
    leather-covered, straight-backed chair was placed behind the table with
    its back to the huge dining room window. Everything that could conceivably
    be needed was arranged on the cloth so as to all be within easy reach from
    the chair. Next, the ornate double doors into the grand salon were slid
    open so that the two dozen or so invited guests could be accommodated
    between the two rooms without having to crowd round the table.</para>

    <para>It was now midsummer dark outside but inside a romantic tallow glow
    belied the long process of lighting all the candles of the many candelabra
    in the hall, reception room, grand salon and dining room. The heavy, blue
    velvet curtains at the windows facing onto the road which passes between
    the front of the house and the park beyond were drawn. The huge shutters
    at windows to the rear of the house were closed, excluding their view of
    the old, formal garden with its ancient copper beech and the waters of the
    Hollandse IJssel beyond. Finally, the curator had gone to the vapour box
    and carefully removed the treasured packet, borne it through the house and
    laid on the table with great reverence.</para>

    <para>Late on the previous day a sober-suited lawyer had brought the
    packet from the safe at the museum's trustees premises in Rotterdam. The
    trustees had been most reluctant to agree to the packet's removal from
    their purview but the curator had stood her ground until they relented.
    The museum was the house where the artifact had been produced and was
    where it's contents should be revealed. It had come home, so to speak, to
    be properly cared for rather than pawed at by soulless money-men. The
    trustees had not capitulated totally, imposing the condition that their
    lawyer remain present throughout proceedings, even keeping an
    uninterrupted vigil beside the vapour box.</para>

    <para>The curator gathered her wandering thoughts, replaced the head torch
    and returned her attention to the packet The guests quietened down at the
    resumption of activity as at the package. This time the curator made
    greater allowance being for the liquid being applied to soak into the
    old-fashioned glue. Timing was of the essence as letting the fine wove
    paper become wet to the point of soggy would also court disaster. But, at
    last, the flap permitted itself to be prised open.</para>

    <para>Now the moment had arrived for the packet to be opened and the cache
    of documents that it had concealed since 1922 released into the light. It
    would have brought a touch of magic to the proceedings had it been
    possible to withdraw the papers one by one with a flourish as a conjurer
    might pull playing cards from a top hat. However, the thoroughness of
    their author's preparation thwarted this performance with an encircling
    girdle of fine, pink, silk ribbon intended to maintain the neatness of her
    precious bundle. This occasioned a further delay as time was needed for
    the careful removal of the intact bundle from its outer clothing, followed
    by the teasing apart of another knot and the laying aside of paper and
    ribbon.</para>

    <para>One hundred years of close confinement had trained the documents to
    stay in their allotted places despite the removal their restraints. The
    curator could not resist giving in to the impulse to theatricality as she
    made a play of clothing her hands in a pair of fine, white cotton gloves,
    slowly smoothing each finger into its sheath. Only when the protective
    gloves were situated to her complete satisfaction was the top paper
    separated from the rest of the pile in preparation for reading its
    contents out to the assembled audience. She faltered now, being a child of
    the age of digital type the curator was unaccustomed to reading this sort
    of handwritten material. It added to the challenge that the text was in
    the shaky hand of an octogenarian given to idiosyncratic abbreviations and
    using an antiquated form of the Dutch language. So, it was a halting but
    contemporary rendition of the letter which was read out loud for the
    benefit of those present:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <attribution>Weduwe Bisdom van Vliet, 21e december 1922</attribution>

      <para>To the people of Haastrecht, My last will and testament, which was
      signed and witnessed this day, bequeaths my house and sufficient of my
      estates to support its upkeep in trust for you, the people of
      Haastrecht, on condition that nothing in the house is changed. When you
      read this letter then one hundred years will have passed since my death
      and the execution of my will must have secured the physical legacy of
      the Bisdom van Vliet family. So, I will now address another aspect of
      the Bisdom van Vliet legacy that I am anxious should be
      preserved.</para>

      <para>It is said that a person is not truly lost to the living whilst
      they are still remembered and spoken of. I believe this to be true.
      Since I am the last Bisdom van Vliet it falls to me to pass on the human
      legacy of my family through means other than the blood line, by which I
      mean my biography as seen through the clear lens of time. The notes,
      letters and diary pages enclosed in this packet have been carefully
      selected by me in order to reveal something of the true characters and
      private lives of the individuals involved. By waiting for a century to
      pass I can be sure that none of those mentioned will neither feel any
      hurt nor be tempted to arrogance by what is contained herein. It is my
      wish that someone will take up their pen to reveal my story.</para>

      <para>I have witnessed many changes during my long life and wish to
      acknowledge that, a century after my passing, much will again be altered
      from the world I know. The last document in this packet is a codicil to
      my original will, which I am assured will be legally binding. In it I
      have made provision for a response to these changes.</para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Anxious to discover what was meant by this unexpected final word
    from the writer, the curator tried to separate the bottom paper from those
    above it but, frustratingly, it refused to budge. So, slowly and
    painstakingly, beginning at the top of the pile, the documents were
    separated one by one then laid out in strict order across the table so
    that the gathering might at least look upon them. The final two documents
    proved to be stuck together by the seal affixed to the bottom one. The
    assembled pile must have been placed on top of the will codicil before the
    wax of its seal had completely set. Once more, the warmed knife was
    patiently applied to achieve the separation of the two documents. Then,
    just as the knife was about to be applied to the removal of the seal from
    the will codicil there was a distraction in the form of a bustle of motion
    and a stage cough nearby. Looking up, the curator came face to stony face
    with the Bisdom van Vliet trust's lawyer.</para>

    <para>
      <quote>I think that we should observe the same legal procedure as is
      usual for the reading of a will. It is my view, also, that the
      appropriate experts in the relevant speciality of the law should be
      consulted in order to make a determination as to whether this additional
      document is, indeed, valid and binding. We need to be sure of our
      position before we announce Weduwe Bisdom van Vliet's final wish to the
      public.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>The curator knew that the lawyer was right despite her frustration
    at the anti-climax of having so nearly exposed this last, unanticipated
    mystery. With reluctance, the sealed document was yielded up to the
    lawyer's outstretched, ungloved hand with a request that the he set about
    making the necessary arrangements as soon as possible. For the time being,
    all that remained was to supervise the museum's guests as they filed past
    the table to view the materials laid out upon it and made their way out of
    the building.</para>

    <para>After what seemed like an eternity, the curator was alone in the
    house. A decade had passed since her appointment as curator of the museum
    during which time she felt that a relationship had developed between
    Paulina, as she called the widow, and herself. The curator lived in a
    small but modern flat in what had previously been part of the house used
    only by servants. Her working days were spent in the dusty splendour of
    the main part of the house which had, indeed, been left in a century long
    time warp. She had also got into the habit of wandering the rooms when the
    museum was closed, sometimes coming to rest in a chair and exercising her
    imagination in order to empathise with Paulina. It would only be right
    that she should be the one to write the widow's biography since she felt
    such a strong connection with her already. This surely gave her the right
    to be the first to see what was contained in the documents Paulina had
    provided as a window onto her life. Resuming her seat at the dinning
    table, the curator replaced her white, cotton gloves and gently picked up
    the first piece of paper ...</para>

  <title>Juni 1869</title>

  <section>
    <title/>
    <para>The door before her opened and Paulina stepped out of the shadow of
    the house into the warm, summer sunshine.</para>

    <para>The early days of June had been exceptionally cold with flurries of
    snow by day and ice-cold nights as winter had reached through spring to
    try its grip on another season. But now the persistent sun swept winter
    into oblivion to give Gouda a glorious Sunday morning. Like many other
    families from the houses lining the sides of the haven, they had decided
    to take advantage of the uplifting weather and walk the short distance to
    Sint Janskerk for morning worship. The trees which shaded the quays were
    in their best green for the day. Children from the schutje moored
    alongside ran in and out of the tree trunks, klompen rattling rhythms on
    the cobbles. Paulina's nieces and nephews longed to join these other
    children in their games but the two governesses kept them all under tight
    control lest they become distracted and lag behind.</para>

    <para>This family party heading for church was not quite complete. Little
    Cornelis Catharinus was only eighteen months old so had remained in his
    nursery. His mother, Aegidia, who was due to deliver her eighth child in
    just a few weeks, had also stayed at home, feeling herself to be too large
    in her pregnancy to venture out and about. She remained indoors trying to
    rest on her <emphasis>chaise longue</emphasis> but actually feeling too
    uncomfortable to settle properly. So it was that Paulina, her half-sister
    - the maiden aunt - walked beside the head of the household and accepted
    the greetings of other church-goers in Aegidia's place.</para>

    <para>Paulina had been an impressionable fifteen year old when Aegidia
    married childhood sweatheart, Theodorus Pieter Viruly. Having recently
    been given Aernout Drost's <emphasis>Hermingard of the Oaken
    Mounds</emphasis> to read she was awash with the idea of romance between
    men and women, especially if the men were heroic. Hearing her parents talk
    about Theo's courageous business decisions and staunch political stands,
    it had seemed to her that he was made of the very stuff of heroism. Then
    there was all the excitement of Aggie's wedding preparations, the house
    being filled with swatches of fabric, dress designs, recipes and table
    dressing catalogues. The look of adoration in Aggie's eyes when she ran to
    Theo upon his arrival at the house and the aura of mystery and delight
    that came over everyone when the honeymoon was alluded to served to
    intensify the the attraction which the febrile girl-woman felt for her
    soon-to-be brother-in-law.</para>

    <para>Although Theo was now almost fifty years of age, Paulina still
    experienced some of the same excitement that she had felt for her romantic
    hero of all those years ago. Although somewhat changed in nature, she
    found that his allure had in some way grown over the years as he had risen
    to become both wealthy and powerful. Under his management the family
    laundry business had transformed itself into a highly lucrative soap and
    candle works in newly built premises. On the domestic front, he had taken
    an old canal-side merchant's dwelling and had it re-built as the grand
    house known simply as 'De Haven'. He had filled his new house with a
    suitable wife and their burgeoning family of healthy children whilst
    finding the time to rise in the world of politics.</para>

    <para>As the family group made their way along Oosthaven quayside, they
    were encouraged towards the church by the tolling of its four great bells.
    From time to time they were obliged to step aside for those worshippers
    who had ordered out their carriages, the east side of the haven being on
    the direct route to the great church. Each time Paulina took to the narrow
    footpath in the shadow of the houses, Theo unwittingly brushed against her
    arm and she began to feel a flush of excitement in anticipation of his
    next touch. She tried to feel ashamed of herself but the light was too
    bewitching, the sun too warming and the sound of the church bells too
    enchanting for her to be able to punish herself for taking an extra morsel
    of pleasure at this physical contact.</para>

    <para>Reaching Dubbele Buurt they had the best view of the Sint Janstoren
    as it rose high into the blue sky, being visible from as far away as
    Waddinxveen. Accident and design had resulted in a layered confection with
    a square base of three distinct stone storeys: the original fourteenth
    century construction being successively topped by additions in 1590 and
    1605. In the mid-seventeenth century, a hexagonal lantern had grown up
    from the stone stump with an openwork section housing a 36-bell carillon.
    Finally, a narrow waist flared again into a small onion-dome from which
    the weather-veined lightening rod seems reach all the way to God in his
    heaven.</para>

    <para>Paulina had the sensation of gently falling backwards as a her gaze
    followed the Sint Janstoren spire right to its tip. She almost reached out
    to Theo to steady herself but that head-swimming moment soon passed as her
    gaze responded to the more earthly need to watch where she was treading on
    the uneven and dung strewn road.</para>

    <para>As they reached the narrowness and bustle of Achter de Kerk a tall
    man in naval uniform stood aside to allow the family party to keep
    together as they went inside to take their places among the congregation.
    Paulina noticed that Theo nodded to him in thanks and, perhaps,
    recognition but no words were exchanged. Then she was caught up in the
    business of settling the family into their pews, taking her place near the
    end of the row so that she might be of some help to the governesses in
    managing the children, each woman now having charge of two young
    ones.</para>

    <para>As it turned out, Paulina was settled between the two eldest
    children: Catharina Johanna, aged eleven-and-a-half, and Maria Elisabeth,
    soon-to-be ten. Both girls were generally well-behaved in church, having
    reached such a stage in their understanding of the world as to appreciate
    the need for mannered behaviour during holy worship. Both also enjoyed the
    chance to show off their fine voices, the fruits of the labours of their
    singing master. Usually their already refined talents and well-developed
    lady-like qualities made Paulina feel quite the dull, country aunt, but
    she was not herself that day and seemed to rise above such
    self-consciousness.</para>

    <para>She had been to services in Sint Janskerk many times before and
    admired its beauty, as it were, from a mental distance. Today the feeling
    of standing back from the scene had left her and she became totally
    absorbed in the magical transformation wrought by the sunlight pouring
    into the vast space of the interior with its high wooden vaults and its
    white walls pierced by lofty glass windows. The great swags of gilded
    organ pipes seemed to shimmer with reflected light. Of all the wonderful
    windows it was the one depicting The Sacrifice of the Prophet Elijah that
    drew Paulina's attention that day. To be precise, she became totally
    absorbed in the image of Margaretha van Parma at the bottom of the
    window.</para>

    <para>In the sixteenth century Margaretha had been Landvoogdes van de
    Nederlanden and, as Governess of the Low Countries, had paid for this
    window to be made as a vanity piece. Paulina must have heard the story of
    Margaretha's life from one of her tutors but had relegated the details to
    the back of her mind. On this sunny, summer, Sunday morning this image of
    a powerful and worldly woman from three centuries ago became an almost
    tangible presence. From beneath the Governess's crown of gold a youthful
    woman's face looked out, exuding strength and confidence which flowed like
    warm wine through Paulina's arteries as she met the eyes in the glass
    portrait.</para>

    <para>Fashionably and opulently dressed in gold cloth, lace and furs,
    Margaretha still managed to be both pious and upright. By contrast,
    Paulina had never been very interested in her appearance, rising above the
    pain of knowing that the people of Haastrecht called her 'the farmer girl'
    behind her back. She had felt that no alchemy of fashion could transform
    her sturdy frame, plain looks and unruly hair into such a beautiful
    creature as Aggie and her friends. The sheer amount of effort it would
    take to make beauty from such unpromising material had always seemed to
    Paulina to be a travesty of nature and of what God had given her. Now,
    though, Margaretha van Parma was giving her permission to make the most of
    herself free from the burden of aiming for the impossible and without the
    worry that she was sinfully vain.</para>

    <para>The more she looked into Margaretha's luminous eyes the more she
    grasped a deeper message from this woman. Yes, Paulina could fulfil her
    destiny as a wealthy and powerful woman without sacrificing the feminine
    desire for marriage and children. Like Margaretha, she would be strong,
    proud and have a masculine consciousness of her place in this world yet
    make a marriage that would produce heirs and stand the test of time. But,
    and a chill note of caution came now, this could only happen if each party
    contracted to a marriage that left them free to follow their individual
    paths. Margaretha had made an undignified and unhappy marriage at sixteen
    to a boy two years her junior, to whom she bore twins, but this liaison
    had metamorphosed over the years into a lasting mutual respect for what
    each was achieving in their lives. Paulina now knew in her heart and soul
    that she would henceforth be her true self, which was so much more than
    the dutiful and dull woman of just moments ago.</para>

    <para>So taken up with these revelations was she that Paulina lost
    awareness of her surroundings until the great organ let out a rich,
    swelling cord startling her back into the present moment with its signal
    that the service was about to start. Her whole being resonated with this
    crescendo in celebration of new beginning and she woke to the moment,
    rising to her feet with the rest of the congregation to devote herself
    heart and soul to the first hymn.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>The service over, the children set off for home with an enthusiasm
    which the governesses could not quite curb. Paulina had expected to stay
    by Theo's side on the return to 'De Haven' but a number of men were
    clearly intent on engaging him in conversation as he left the church. No
    doubt they were taking the opportunity to press their interests with the
    man who was not only their councillor and alderman but was also a senator
    in the Eerste Kamer of parliament in Den Haag. She waited for the bulk of
    the congregation to depart before wandering back towards Oosthaven by
    herself, yet not feeling alone. As she regained the quays she saw that the
    schuitje that had been moored alongside earlier was now being worked
    through the gates of the Donkere Sluis. Along with several other
    churchgoers, she stopped to watch as the little boat negotiated this
    awkward navigation, enjoying the unhurried nature of the activity and the
    feel of the day.</para>

    <para>From across the lock, a group of children began singing with great
    gusto the old rhyme to encourage the rowers of the 'little cooking pot'
    boat:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><literallayout><emphasis>Schuitje varen, theetje drinken,
Varen we naar de Overtoom.
Drinken er zoete melk met room.
Zoete melk met brokken,
Kindje mag niet jokken.</emphasis><footnote>
            <para>
Sail your boat, drink your tea,
We're sailing to the Overtoom*.
Drinking sweet milk with cream.
Sweet milk with bread lumps,
children, don't tell fibs.
*The Overtoom was a canal in the suburbs of Amsterdam that connected important waterways.</para>
          </footnote></literallayout></para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Looking over at the impromptu choir, she was surprised to find her
    eyes meeting those of the naval officer whom the family had briefly
    encountered on the way into church. They exchanged smiles which encouraged
    the officer to make his way over the set of lock gates on the IJssel side
    as soon as they closed and she soon found him standing before her,
    extending his hand in introduction,</para>

    <para><quote>Lieutenant le Fèvre de Montigny at your
    service.</quote></para>

    <para>He bowed low over her hand before releasing it but continuing to
    look directly into her eyes. His own eyes were a liquid brown and she
    began to feel herself falling as if into a deep pool. He was tall, slim
    and very attractive. He had combed his thick, black hair back from his
    forehead and applied just enough Macassar oil so that it shone in the
    sunlight. His facial whiskers were also dark and dense, spreading down his
    jaw and across his top lip, yet his chin and neck were shaved bare as was
    the fashion in Den Haag.</para>

    <para><quote>I think you are a relative of Mr Viruly. You have his
    stature.</quote></para>

    <para>She was amazed that he, the first person whom she had encountered
    since Margaretha had awakened her, could appreciate that she was a
    significant woman.</para>

    <para><quote>I am Paulina Bisdom van Vliet, his wife's
    half-sister.</quote></para>

    <para>All her life she had insisted on being known as “Paulina” so that
    she would be distinguished from her grandmother, Paulina Maria
    Hondorff-Block, after whom she had been named. It came as a surprise to
    her to find that she had suddenly and without thought reclaimed her proper
    name, her own name.</para>

    <para><quote>Your father is the burgemeester of Haastrecht?</quote></para>

    <para>She nodded assent.</para>

    <para><quote>Then I have had the honour of making his acquaintance at my
    brother's house. Gilles was the burgemeester of Berkel and Rodenrijs and
    has just become burgemeester of Hillegerberg and Bergschenhoek. Both your
    father and Viruly were his supporters in gaining his improved
    appointment.</quote></para>

    <para>She was glad to hear that he moved in the same social circles as her
    family and was not going to prove an embarrassment to be seen talking to.
    She also liked that he was tall. Looking up to him made her feel feminine
    since she was herself taller than most men. Anxious now that their
    conversation should not flag, she enquired,</para>

    <para><quote>Are you in Gouda with your ship?</quote></para>

    <para><quote>I am between voyages at present and like to stay at the Hotel
    De Zalm here. So, it is fortuitous that we have met today. I see that you
    are watching the operation of the lock, do you have an interest in
    navigation?</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Since I was a child I watched boats pass our house on the
    Hollandse IJssel and bring cargo along the Vlist to the Haven in
    Haastrecht, but I know nothing of the sea or of the marine.</quote></para>

    <para>He easily took up her conversational opening and began to tell of
    his sea voyages, allowing Paulina to ask questions and show interest at
    appropriate points so that she did not feel excluded. They had just
    arrived at Curaçao in the West Indies, where Lieutenant le Fèvre de
    Montigny's ship was visited by Governor Landsbergen, when she noticed that
    Theo had detached himself from his followers and was approaching. Since
    the two men were acquainted, she expected Theo to join them but instead he
    slowed to a stop a pace or two away, clearly waiting for her to join him.
    She was somewhat reluctant to part from the handsome lieutenant but also
    understood that one did not keep Theodorus Pieter Viruly waiting. The
    lieutenant noticed the social dilemma she faced and quickly resolved it
    for her by turning and taking a step towards Theo, thus allowing her to do
    the same. The lieutenant then greeted Theo enthusiastically,</para>

    <para><quote>Good morning, Mayor Viruly! Let me give you my
    hand!</quote></para>

    <para>Theo only briefly touched the hand extended to him and grunted a
    greeting in reply before offering Paulina his arm and steering her in the
    direction of Oosthaven. So swift was her disengagement from the lieutenant
    that she felt her farewell was cut so short as to be almost rude. Minded
    to say something to Theo as she was rather cross with him not only for
    leaving her alone after church but also for tearing her away from her
    handsome new friend, she chided him,</para>

    <para><quote>Lieutenant le Fèvre de Montigny was good enough to escort me
    after church since your politics detained you for so long. I found his
    company most engaging and understood that you and he were acquainted. I am
    sorry to be parted from him so briskly and hope that I shall meet him
    again.</quote></para>

    <para>Theo was silent for some time before replying,</para>

    <para><quote>Yes, I have met le Fèvre de Montigny and so has your father.
    His brother is in politics and looks to do well. I am sorry if you thought
    me rather unfriendly just now.</quote></para>

    <para>There the matter rested and they were soon back inside De Haven and
    into the thick of family life once more.</para>

    <title/>

    <para>Sunday dinner was a family meal and rather chaotic so it was well
    into the afternoon before Aegidia and Paulina were alone. Paulina went to
    sit with Aggie as she tried to rest since she said that she often got
    bored by being so inactive and left all by herself. It was not long before
    Aggie remarked upon the change in Paulina's demeanour, saying that she
    seemed somehow stronger in herself yet almost girlishly excited at the
    same time.</para>

    <para>Aggie knew her half-sister well having moved to the burgemeester's
    house following his marriage to her mother. Aggie had been seven when
    Paulina was born and the age gap between them had not always been
    comfortable. They became closer after Aggie's older brother and sister
    both died in the same year, throwing the two daughters into each other's
    company when the one was just past childhood at eleven and the other, at
    eighteen, was almost a woman. Their relationship came into full bloom
    after Aggie married and the children started to come along. She had felt
    able to confide things in Paulina which she did not care to share with
    their mother. In return, Paulina had confided her horror at the string of
    unappealing young men who had been put before her as potential husbands.
    They had laughed together at their coarse features, or their foppish
    dress, or their arrogant manners, or their blatant desire to advance
    themselves through marriage. Aggie had also wiped away the tears when the
    ones that Paulina did like had disappeared, never to return to her
    side.</para>

    <para>Now, once she heard that Paulina had been talking to a handsome
    young naval lieutenant that morning, Aggie pressed her for all the details
    of the encounter. As Paulina started talking about him she
    self-consciously realised that she sounded just like a girl in love. Aggie
    picked up on this immediately, asking,</para>

    <para><quote>Tell me, sister, did you perhaps flirt with him a
    little?</quote></para>

    <para>Paulina found herself blushing and left with no choice but to
    confess that perhaps she had – just a little.</para>

    <para><quote>I am so pleased for you that you have found someone who takes
    your fancy! Now, let us consider how suitable a match he would be for you.
    What do you know of his family?</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Well, his brother is a burgemeester and both papa and Theo
    know him. He is an officer in the marine, too, and looks so handsome in
    his uniform! He has such interesting things to say about his voyages and
    the places he has visited. I wonder if he has ever been in a battle? He
    didn't say.</quote></para>

    <para><quote>I think that you are getting a little distracted! If he were
    in the military then I would know exactly who his family is. There were
    illustrious military engineers called le Fèvre de Montigny, so he may be
    connected with them. In which case, he is of the patriciate and socially
    on a par with us. We should ask Theo or papa to find out
    more.</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Oh, but isn't that making rather a lot of fuss after just
    one, brief meeting?</quote></para>

    <para><quote>My dear! I have never seen you show such an interest in a man
    and I am so excited for you that I want to help all I can. He just might
    be the right one for you and we shouldn't let him get away! It is not as
    though you are a mere girl and this just an infatuation that will be gone
    by tomorrow! You will be twenty nine years old in a few days and have a
    mature woman's sensibilities and not a little experience in dealing with
    potential suitors. I think that we need to find out more about your
    handsome stranger.</quote></para>

    <para><quote>But what if he is married or I don't feel the same next time
    I see him?</quote></para>

    <para><quote>We must be patient and leave it to the men to find out more.
    But, in the meantime, perhaps we can make sure that you chance upon a
    second meeting? You said that he is resident at Hotel De Zalm? Well then,
    it should be easy! If you find reason to stroll in the Markt for long
    enough you are sure to encounter him. You might even take coffee at the
    hotel during the cheese market. How I wish that my condition allowed me to
    go with you! As it is, my great belly would be enough to put off any
    man!</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Poor Aggie, is it really so bad?</quote></para>

    <para><quote>I must confess that I am finding it exhausting this time. The
    doctor says that this must be my last pregnancy if I am to fully recover
    my health after the birth. But I seem to become pregnant so easily that I
    am not sure how I shall stop! I could go on to have another five or ten
    children before I am too old to conceive! What a dreadful
    thought!</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Our mama must have been about the same age as you when I was
    born yet there were no more children after me. Poor papa, he so wanted a
    son to inherit his position and wealth but all he got was me! Which brings
    me to the other thing that happened to me today: I have become resolved to
    do all that I can do in this life and not be hindered by the limitations
    on what is expected of me because of my sex. I was looking at Margaretha
    van Parma in the stained glass window I was sitting under in church this
    morning and she seemed pour her strength into me. So, if le Fèvre de
    Montigny is to be my husband, he had better know that I shall not bend
    myself or my destiny to accommodate his - or anyone else's - notion of
    wifely behaviour!</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Good gracious, Paulina. You are quite disconcerting
    me!</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Well, you might as well know straight away that I now call
    myself Paulina, with the 'a' that I was Christened with. I assure you that
    nobody will ever confuse me with old Oma now!</quote></para>

    <para><quote>I am quite sure that you are right in that! Now,
    Paulin-with-an-A, I have had quite enough excitement for one day so,
    please will you read to me for a while? Since I must spend so much of my
    day in idleness I thought I should exercise my mind in compensation.
    Whilst you were at church I began reading 'Max Havelaar' to see what all
    the fuss was about when it was published some years ago. I have to confess
    that Mr Douwes Dekker's style is most conducive to rest as it fails to
    excite. Yet, I feel that I must continue with it as the subject matter is
    important. Theo is concerned with the political debates about our East
    Indies colonies so it will be good to inform myself about the topic so
    that I might appear more knowledgeable and interested when he talks of his
    work in Den Haag.</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Is that the Multatuli book?</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Yes.</quote></para>

    <para><quote>What a strange <emphasis>nom de
    plume</emphasis>.</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Apparently it is Latin for 'I have borne much' – which seems
    appropriate for my situation! I fear that the poor man had a bad time of
    things in Java. It seems such a far-away place and such a different place
    to Holland that I find it hard to believe that his tales have much to do
    with us ordinary Dutch people. It has caused quite a stir, though. Maybe
    you will be able to put some excitement into it when you read a passage
    for me?</quote></para>

    <para>Paulina did try to make the tale interesting but Aggie was soon fast
    asleep and she did not chose to carry on with the book for herself.
    Unwilling to risk waking Aggie by leaving the room in order to fetch her
    writing materials, she reached for the novel by Ouida which Aggie had just
    finished reading and commended to her. Fortunately this was in translation
    from the original English, a language in which Aggie was competent but
    that was opaque to Paulina. So, to find <emphasis>Idalia</emphasis> in
    Dutch had been something of a treat, especially since the story was
    compelling enough to distract her from her passion for keeping her
    journal.</para>

    <para>Immediately captivated by the courageous, clever, independent and
    muscular Queen's Messenger with the exotic, Scottish name of Sir Fulke
    Erceldoune, Paulina had been gathered up and swept along with his headlong
    fall for the beautiful Countess Idalia Vassalis, who had saved his life,
    Hoping for a romantic, happy ending, it had been distressing to discover
    that Idalia was actually an enchantress who bewitched men then bent them
    to her political will before discarding them or, worse, sending them to
    their deaths. But all was not lost and Paulina became heartened again by
    the prospect of Idalia's love for Fulke being the saving grace which would
    reform her, showing her to be a virtuous soul worthy of the hero's
    devotion after all. The novel was proving to be a much more riveting way
    of exercising the moral faculties than her usual diet of the sermons and
    poetry of Utrecht minister Nicolaas Beets, whose latest tome remained
    buried in her luggage.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>Despite Aggie's urging her to frequent the environs of Hotel De Zalm
    in the hope of another encounter with the handsome naval officer, several
    days elapsed before Paulina again set foot outside 'De Haven'. She was to
    accompany Theo once more but this time they were not headed for church but
    for the new railway station. It was another glorious summer day as they
    left the house and were handed into the Viruly's smart, new Victoria
    carriage with it's liveried driver. Paulina had a keen eye for horse flesh
    and was appreciative of the fine pair of bay mares which were harnessed
    and waiting patiently, their coats gleaming in the sunlight.</para>

    <para>The carriage hood was down so that they were open to the sights,
    sounds and feel of day. They had no sooner set off along Oosthaven heading
    for the Markt when the Sint Janskerk carillon began chiming out the
    Meideun tune to signal the hour for ten o'clock. Paulina let herself relax
    back into her seat so as to fully enjoy the music, the sun's warmth and
    the sights as they made their progress past the stepped gables and slender
    spires of the stadhuis in the centre of the market square before taking
    the Hoogstradt, crossing the Turfsingel and Kattensingel canal bridges to
    reach Stationsplein.</para>

    <para>It had to be admitted that there was rather more excitement for
    their outing today than there had been last Sunday for this was a day of
    celebration for Theo. The people of Gouda had not taken easily to the
    notion of rail transport when their business had done so well out of the
    shipping that passed through Holland's busiest river junction. It had been
    unfortunate that the first train line was laid to the north of the city
    centre, being unable to breach the walls and canals so as to arrive at a
    more convenient location. Indeed, the townsmen had refused to contribute
    to the building of a proper station leaving train travellers to make do
    with a rather basic wooden construction beside the single track which
    linked Rotterdam and Utrecht.</para>

    <para>Characteristically undaunted, Theo had worked hard on behalf of the
    Nederlandsche Rhijnspoorweg-Maatschappij, of which he was a shareholder
    and board member, and today his efforts would come to fruition. He had
    exercised his political skills to have the town boundary re-drawn so that
    the station now lay within Gouda's compass. His business acumen was
    instrumental in the development of a second track which, passing through
    Harmelen and Breukelen, would soon enable travel between Rotterdam and
    Amsterdam. A third line to Den Haag would follow making it possible to
    travel easily between Holland's three great maritime cities: Rotterdam,
    Amsterdam and Den Haag. Competition from the Hollandsche IJzeren
    Spoorweg-Maatschappij's direct line between Rotterdam and Amsterdam via
    Den Haag had been successfully beaten off, largely because Theo had
    advocated investment in modern engineering techniques to deal with the
    problems of laying track across waterlogged land.</para>

    <para>The Rhijnspoorweg line continued beyond Gouda to Utrecht and Arnhem
    then went on to Oberhausen across the border, thus opening up not only the
    whole of the central and eastern Netherlands but also Germany. Theo had
    grasped the possibility that at least some of the anticipated numbers of
    people on board all these trains might be encouraged to break their
    journey in Gouda and contribute to the town's trade. To this end he had
    persuasively argued that a station which made the right impression on the
    travel hardened and weary was crucial to local enterprise. Today was to
    see the first stage Theo's grand vision for his home town realised when
    passengers from Rotterdam and Utrecht would be able to alight at Gouda's
    distinctive new station building which offered all the facilities a
    traveller might require. A group of specially invited guests were to
    arrive on the next train from Rotterdam and join with the local
    dignitaries for a formal opening ceremony followed by inaugural
    festivities in the station's restaurant.</para>

    <para>Having arrived at the station in good time for the train from
    Rotterdam, Theo left Paulina to stroll around the building and platform
    whilst he went to check that all was in order. He had wanted to be early
    so that he could round up the chosen members of the welcoming party and
    ensure that everyone was in the right place at the right time, and doing
    the right thing. Anxious that Gouda and its station should gain the
    approval of the august company soon to arrive, he had worked hard to
    ensure that the building was ready, the staff well-trained and provided
    with new uniforms, and the restaurant able to lay on a sumptous mid-day
    meal.</para>

    <para>Paulina had caught some of his mood and paced restlessly and
    aimlessly around. First she wandered through the ticket hall with its
    window already manned in preparation for the first customers and the
    porters with their trolleys waiting to assist with luggage. Then she
    investigated the waiting rooms, declining the attentions of the maid who
    was eager to seat her in the women's room. Paulina was unable to sit or
    stand still, however, and soon passed out onto the platform. Everywhere
    was lavishly decked in bunting or garlanded with fresh flowers whose scent
    barely masked the lingering odour of fresh paint. Paulina found herself
    gazing hopefully in the direction from which the Rotterdam train would
    arrive, although she knew it was not yet due for some time.</para>

    <para>The excitement of the occasion was especially heightened for Paulina
    as her beloved papa was one of the honoured guests due to arrive by train
    as he returned from a week attending to his shipping business in
    Rotterdam. It had been decided that, following the station opening, she
    and papa would continue on home to Haastrecht together in the comfort of
    Theo's new carriage. On its return journey to Gouda the carriage would
    bring mama, Paulina and Aggie's mother, who wanted to be on hand in plenty
    of time for the arrival of the new baby. Paulina was looking forward to
    swapping news with her father, the urgency for which seemed to be further
    fuelled by their at daily exchange of letters. She had also begun to
    hanker for home and, if truth were told, was keen to exercise her spirit
    and mind in the management of the family house and estates. As was usual
    for daughters of the patriciate, her education had all been in
    preparationfor the conduct her own affairs upon her marriage. So far, she
    had been afforded little opportunity to test herself in this respect,
    having been cast as assistant to her mother. Paulina had always deferred
    to her mama's way of doing things but now her new-found confidence and
    strength of will made her determined to take charge and be autonomous. She
    found the prospect of being in control during mama's absence quite
    exhilarating.</para>

    <para>The tasks ahead of her were busily running through her head as
    Paulina turned to retrace her steps to the entrance hall. Suddenly he was
    there! Not in his uniform this time, but her heart recognised him before
    she was fully conscious of it and let out an involuntary cry then hastily
    put her hands to her face as if to push the noise back inside of her. At
    the muffled sound he turned from supervising the porter who was stacking
    his luggage and quickly covered the distance between them.</para>

    <para><quote>Is there something the matter?</quote></para>

    <para>He asked and before she had time to think about what she would say
    Paulina had replied,</para>

    <para><quote>Oh, no, not at all! I had so hoped to see you again but now
    it seems that you are going away, perhaps on a long sea
    voyage!</quote></para>

    <para>She was aware that this was a rather bold and forthright utterance,
    although it was truthful. But Johan Jacob le Fèvre de Montigny was not a
    man to be thrown by forwardness in a woman, finding the whole
    <emphasis>etiquette</emphasis> of courtship rather tedious. He happily
    replied in kind whilst hoping to be able to put a name to her vaguely
    recalled face.</para>

    <para><quote>Do not concern yourself, my dear, I am merely paying a visit
    to my brother in Hillegersberg. I shall not be far away and, in any case,
    will return to De Zalm in a week or so's time. Are you taking the train
    yourself?</quote></para>

    <para><quote>No, I am here in my step-sister's place beside Theo Viruly at
    the opening ceremony; and to meet my father who is arriving with the
    official party from Rotterdam. We are to go home to Haastrecht later today
    but I am sure that I shall be back in Gouda once my latest niece or nephew
    arrives.</quote></para>

    <para>At last, Johan placed the woman. She was the only daughter of the
    burgemeester of Haastrecht and she seemed to be setting her cap at him. He
    was intrigued!</para>

    <para><quote>My brother is among the burgemeesters from Rotterdam who have
    been invited today. Perhaps you would like to be introduced to
    him?</quote></para>

    <para><quote>Oh, yes, that would be delightful! You can meet my father,
    too! This has really turned out to be a most fortunate
    encounter!</quote></para>

    <para>Johan had a vague sense that he was not quite in control of the way
    things were going as the young woman seemed to be slightly more
    enthusiastic than his polite offer of an introduction warranted. Since he
    couldn't quite put his finger on what, if anything, was wrong with it, he
    went along with her enthusiasm and nodded his agreement.</para>

    <para>A sudden commotion of people arriving on the platform from inside
    the station building put paid to any further dialogue. Theo was
    marshalling the reception committee into place whilst the station master
    took up a position at the platform's edge, extracting his shiny new
    timepiece from the pocket of his smart uniform coat and consulting it. It
    would not do for his first train to be late! A distant whistle reassured
    him that all was well as Theo stepped up beside him in readiness to greet
    the distinguished city men.</para>

    <para>The driver skilfully halted his train so that the door of the first
    class carriage containing his most notable passengers came to rest exactly
    beside the two waiting men. The carriage door was opened with some
    ceremony by the station master and the men inside began to alight. Theo
    shook the hand of each before they passed on to mingle with the local
    mayors and patriarchs behind him. Paulina was only looking for one face,
    that of her father, Marcellus. As soon as she saw him she was hardly able
    to stop herself from running to him. He had seen her, too, and extricated
    himself from the round of greetings as soon as was polite so that they
    were soon embracing affectionately.</para>

    <para>Meanwhile, Johan had located his brother and worked his way into the
    crowd to place himself at Gillis's right elbow. The brothers did not
    exchange greetings and seemed not to acknowledge each other, yet they
    moved through the cluster of guests as one. Johan lost no time in shaking
    hands and swapping names with many prominent men who assumed that he, too,
    was important. He was charming and personable, seeming to be in the
    acquaintance of the burgemeester of the rapidly developing Hellegesburg
    district of Rotterdam. Gillis le Fèvre de Montigny had recently been
    appointed to this promising position after serving for several years in a
    smaller, less notable district where he had nevertheless made the right
    impression. Brother Johan eased himself into the social benefit afforded
    by his association with Gillis and merged with the invited guests.</para>

    <para>Paulina and Marcellus worked their way through the crowd to be near
    Theo as he delivered his formal speech, declared the station open and,
    after others had made their speeches, led the assembled party into the
    restaurant where they were seated for the meal. Paulina found that her
    appetite was unusually slight and that her eyes constantly sought out
    Johan, who seemed to have been been made room for at the end of a table,
    near the door. His brother sat next to him and appeared to be animatedly
    monopolising his attention. Occasionally they would look in her direction
    and she would quickly look away but just sometimes her eyes met Johan's
    only and they held each other’s gaze unabashed. Mostly, however, she was
    able to take him in as he devoted his attention to his food and his
    brother. He was every bit as handsome as she remembered and stirred her
    passion no less now that he has was out of his uniform and in a smart
    tailcoat and suit.</para>

    <para>For her own part, she was glad that she had put on her favourite
    carriage dress with its flatteringly cut jacket in a darker blue to the
    full-skirted, lightweight dress beneath. It was quite a new costume and,
    she had been assured by the dressmaker, fashionable. As was the Mantilla
    which she had been persuaded would complete the look. But Paulina found
    that her boisterous hair defeated all attempts to attach the flimsy
    Spanish creation which, in any case, made her feel uncomfortably tall as
    it's comb added a good hand's breadth to her height. She had tossed the
    Mantilla into a drawer at home and was now relieved not to have the worry
    of it.</para>

    <para>The meal over, people began to leave the table and pass out of the
    restaurant. The train for Rotterdam was due at any moment so leave-takings
    began. Theo and Marcellus passed among the Rotterdam guests, shaking hands
    and saying a few well-chosen words to each of them. Paulina tried to keep
    up with them and do as they did but was finding it difficult to connect
    socially with any of the men. She might have felt aggrieved by their
    overlooking her but was distracted from the whole enterprise when she
    noticed that Johan and his brother were heading through the throng in her
    direction. She then focussed her own efforts on managing matters so that
    Marcellus was at hand when the brothers arrived before her.</para>

    <para>Before Paulina could concern herself with including her father in
    the introductions she found that Gillis le Fèvre de Montigny had taken
    this social manoeuvre upon himself, deftly separating the four of them
    into a discrete group away from the mass of people. Gillis drew upon a
    slight previous acquaintance with Marcellus and the latter's current mood
    of fellowship to all around in order to engage his attention. Once he had
    ensured that all four were known to each other and a cordial atmosphere
    prevailed, he swiftly moved on to issue an invitation to dine at his new
    house in Hillegesburg. Marcellus explained that the family were waiting
    upon a new arrival so his wife would not be travelling far in the near
    future. Most extraordinarily, Marcellus then heard himself issue an
    invitation for the le Fèvre de Montignys to take lunchewon at Haastrecht
    the following week. The invitation was readily accepted, a date and time
    agreed and hasty farewells made as the Rotterdam train was now standing at
    the platform with Johan's luggage being loaded aboard.</para>

    <para>Once released from his civic duties, Theo had prevailed upon
    Marcellus and Paulina to come into the house and take refreshment with
    Aggie whilst Paulina's luggage was being stowed on the carriage. Once the
    sisters were together it was inevitable that an account of Johan's
    presence at the station opening should burst from Paulina. Marcellus,
    being a good natured man and exceedingly fond of his daughter, joined in
    with their excitement, proclaiming,</para>

    <para><quote>I do believe that you are a little enamoured of this
    gentleman!</quote></para>

    <para>To the surprise of all present Paulina announced,</para>

    <para><quote>Yes, father. He is the man I am going to
    marry!</quote></para>

    <para>Everyone had been somewhat taken aback by Paulina's announcement but
    the tone of determination in her voice brooked of no contrary comments.
    Such a brief acquaintance seemed hardly the basis for a life-long
    commitment and would usually have been dismissed as a passing fancy.
    However, in the circumstances there was an element of relief as it was
    proving difficult to find a suitable husband for her. Many tactful
    introductions had been made over the years since she came of age but she
    had shown no interest in forming any sort of attachment either
    romantically or pragmatically.</para>

    <para>It had not been easy to entice eligible bachelors in Paulina's
    direction, either. She was somewhat out of the ordinary in her physical
    appearance, being both tall and sturdy, as well as lacking in any dress
    sense or gracefulness. She was educated to manage her inheritance but not
    accomplished in literature, music or art and spoke no foreign languages.
    Although she spent hours each day at her writing desk, the result was
    perhaps best described as mental outpourings.</para>

    <para>Paulina's enthusiasm for this man at least got over the first hurdle
    on the course towards marriage. However, two major stumbling blocks
    remained. Was this relative stranger a suitable person to be the husband
    of the only daughter of a wealthy and powerful patrician. Paulina stood to
    inherit a great deal of property in her own right but could only retain
    her father's power if she had a husband to act on her behalf. Even
    assuming his credentials passed scrutiny, there was the small matter of
    whether Johan Jacob le Fèvre de Montigny was actually interested in
    marrying Paulina.</para>

    <para>Because of these concerns, Marcellus made a point of having a
    private talk with Theo before leaving for Haastrecht. The two men pooled
    what little they knew of Paulina's potential suitor, starting with their
    shared assumption that he came from a family with an illustrious military
    past. That said, they next agreed that the brothers Gillis and Johan
    appeared to have been born in obscurity but to be men of means; where,
    they wondered, had this money come from? Theo was also privy to the
    rumours circulating at parliament in Den Haag concerning the dubious
    morals of the King's eldest son, Hendrik the Navigator. Johan's name had
    been mentioned as one of the set who joined in the Prince's notorious
    bouts of drinking and womanising. Neither man was keen to ally their
    innocent Paulina to a man of dissolute habits.</para>

    <para>Doubts clouded the enthusiasm of father and brother-in-law for
    Paulina's choice of husband and they saw it as their duty to find out more
    before matters progressed too far. Not only did they wish to spare Paulina
    the pain of future disillusionment, but they were also eager to avoid any
    scandal which association with the wrong sort of man might bring down upon
    their heads. It was agreed that Theo would quickly pay a visit to Den Haag
    where he knew of a clever and discrete man whom he would engage to
    investigate and report back directly on the young lieutenant.</para>

    <para>The man waiting patiently at the edge of the room was quite
    unremarkable. He could neither be described as tall nor short, thick-set
    nor thin, dark nor fair and he wore clothes that were neither rough nor
    elegant. His features were unremarkable, his stance relaxed and confident
    without being in any way challenging. Like a moth on a wall at dusk, you
    would not notice him until, that is, he moved. Then his talent for mimicry
    displayed itself in far more complex and dynamic ways than were available
    to any insect. His movements and gestures could mirror those of the people
    around him, as could his voice, accent and expressions. Upon first meeting
    him almost anyone would feel the sort of rapport that presages a lifelong
    friendship, yet you could pass him in the street unrecognised within an
    hour of taking him into your heart – and confidence.</para>

    <para>His plain clothing concealed a muscular and agile body that was well
    able to deal with trouble of a physical kind, as well as a short-bladed
    knife and small pistol which he could apply with skill should the
    necessity arise. Fortunately, no such circumstance had arisen in the
    conduct of this particular case, yet, despite its apparently
    straightforward and safe nature, this matter had caused him some
    perturbation. Viruly was not his only client and there were more powerful
    interests with far fatter purses which had to be taken into account when
    presenting his report.</para>

    <para>As was usual in these circumstances, the man would give his findings
    verbally. He had previously ordered his thoughts on paper then, blessed
    with a photographic memory, destroyed any trace of written material before
    presenting himself before his client. The man's stoic wait was eventually
    rewarded when the door to the room opened and closed as Viruly entered his
    Den Haag office. Even so, it wasn't until Viruly had settled himself
    behind the desk that he became aware of the man's presence, feeling rather
    discomforted at being caught unawares. The man gave Viruly an arch look
    and continued to wait in silence until Viruly got up and crossed the room
    in order that an envelope of bank notes could be transferred from Viruly's
    inside coat pocket to that of the man.</para>

    <para>Viruly seated himself behind the desk once more and gestured to the
    man that he should take the visitor's seat opposite him but the man
    indicated that he preferred to stand. He moved forward into the spotlight
    of sunshine let in by the window as a signal that he was ready to begin
    his narrative. So far, not a word had been uttered by either party and
    Viruly was unwilling to be the one to break the oddly monastic atmosphere
    so, instead of speaking, he elected to open the palm of his right hand and
    extend it in front of him as an invitation to the other to start what was
    clearly set up to be an uninterrupted soliloquy. The account which
    followed was delivered without embellishment or dramatic interpretation,
    the man reading the words from the inside of his expressionless eyes. Its
    listener was left to interpret what he heard for himself and form what
    judgement he may of the individual it concerned.</para>

    <para>
      <quote>The subject, Johan Jacob le Fèvre de Montigny, is the second
      living son of Johan Jacob le Fèvre de Montigny, after whom he was named,
      and Petronella Henrietta Kleijn. His father was called to the ministry
      of the Nederlandse Hevormde Kerk as a young man and all his family
      practice that religion.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>He has one surviving older brother, Gillis Johannes le Fèvre de
      Montigny, named after his grandfather. This brother was born in 1837 in
      the village of Kwadijk in the Zeevang community of North Holland, his
      father being the pastor resident there. A second child, Bartolomeus,
      born in 1938, did not survive infancy. The family were quite short of
      funds at this time.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>In 1839 the family moved to Nieuwe Tonge in the community of
      Middleharnis on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in South Holland. Here
      Johan Jacob junior was born in 1840 and another child, Henri Pieter,
      arrived some years later.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>Johan Jacob senior was predikant of the parish of Nieuwe Tonge
      for the remainder of his lifetime, his fortunes improving such that he
      was registered as a landowner at his death in 1849. It is said that his
      new parish was granted as the result of the application of both power
      and money on the part of his parents. Nieuwe Tonge was certainly an
      improvement on Kwadijk in both location, being close to his family, and
      in possessing an environment more favourable for both physical and
      financial health. However, his choice of profession is rather at odds
      with the occupations of the rest of his well-respected patrician
      family.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>The subject's grandfather, Gillis Johannes senior, married Lena
      van der Sluys in 1807 at Zwartewaal, near Brielle on the island of
      Voorne-Putten in South Holland. They had two daughters and two sons who
      survived into adulthood. The daughters, who are the eldest children,
      married well. Maria Johanna wed Arij Jacobusz Hogendijk, a shipowner and
      merchant, and lives in Vlardingen. The Hogendijks are a clan of
      shipbuilders and builders in the area of Krimpen aan den IJssel. Jacoba
      Elena wed Johannes Oudorp Kotebrant who was appointed mayor of Kralingen
      near Rotterdam in 1867. The Oudorp family also has connections in the
      East Indies. A fourth and youngest child, Jacob known as Jacques,
      requires money for his care and always lives with a family member. He
      was in the home of Lena van der Sluys until her death in 1859, some 38
      years after her husband, at Oudendijk. Jaques now lives with the
      Kralingen branch of the family but it has not been possible to discover
      what ails him.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>The subject's grandfather, Gillis Johannes le Fèvre de Montigny
      was born at Den Bosch in North Brabant in 1765 and died at Maasluis in
      South Holland in 1821. In 1776 he became a Kornet in the Regiment
      Oranje-Gelderland. By 1782 he had risen to the rank of Kolonel in the
      Korps Ingenieurs which became Korps der Genie in 1806 then the
      Koninklijk Korps der Artillerie en Genie in 1807. He is noted and
      respected for his work in map-making and, less so, for the design of
      defensive structures. In 1806 he was appointed examiner of surveys to
      the land register. The Koninklijk Korps der Artillerie en Genie closed
      in 1810 after French came to power but Kolonel le Fèvre de Montigny was
      one of the few to retain his rank in the French army.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>Thus from 1810 – 1811 the Kolonel was <emphasis>chef de
      battailion</emphasis> 1e Klasse. He was designated premier administrator
      to Hollandse cadaster which surveyed and mapped the Netherlands in order
      to create the land register which was to form the basis of new tax laws
      on property. He held this post until 1817 and is best known for the
      quality of his work and for taking a principled stand over
      standardization and detail in his surveys. This was deemed both costly
      and irrelevant by those in charge of the project but le Fèvre de
      Montigny stood fast and overcame this opposition to oversee the
      production of the first set of detailed and accurate maps of our
      country.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>The subject's grandfather had followed in the military footsteps
      of his own father, Johan Nicolaas le Fèvre de Montigny, who joined the
      Korps Ingenieurs as a Kornet 1776 and rose to the rank of
      Lieutenant-Kolonel in 1795. Johan Nicolaas became Directeur of
      Nederrijn- en IJssellinie defensive works, for which he produced the
      first accurate maps of Overijssel and Zeeland.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>To return to more recent events. The subject and two brothers
      were still minors in the care of their mother, Petronella Henrietta
      Kleijn, when their grandmother, Lena van der Sluys, died in 1857. At
      this point the three pastor's sons inherited a significant amount of
      money, being their father's share of the estate. The subject's
      grandmother owned a great deal of land around Brielle which was sold by
      her heirs and the proceeds apportioned between them. The subject's
      mother did not benefit from this inheritance and died some years later
      at the age of fifty three. I could find no trace of the younger brother
      after that event.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>At the time that he benefited from his inheritance the older
      brother, Gillis Johannes, was employed as a candidate notary in Den
      Haag. After his grandmother's death he moved to Brielle then, in 1864,
      gave up the law and went to live in Berkel near Rotterdam, having been
      appointed burgemeester of Berkel and Rodenrijs at the end of the
      previous year. Gillis Johannes has recently been appointed burgemeester
      of Hillegersberg and Bergschenhoek, which neighbours his previous
      constituency yet is more favourably located for development as a
      substantial centre of business and an elegant residential area. It would
      seem that the subject's brother has used his new-found wealth and his
      ancestor's influential name in order to progress a career in politics.
      In 1866 he married Maria Woutherina van Haaften in Den Haag. To date, he
      has one son, an infant given the family names of Johan Jacob. He has
      just built a substantial villa in Hillegersberg where the subject is
      also currently residing.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>As to the subject's biography, he attended a private elementary
      school in Hilversum then, aged 14, commenced training as a sea-going
      officer in the navy. The reasons for his taking this course of action
      rather than following the family preference for the military are not
      known. The Naval Training School in Den Helder did not exist at that
      time so our subject's training was arranged as a private matter between
      the family and appropriate sea captains. Perhaps the influence of his
      family background set him on the course of becoming a navigation
      officer.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>The man smiled wryly to himself behind his stony face as he examined
    his client for any sign that his little pun had been appreciated. He often
    played such a small trick at this point in his monologues in order to
    discover whether his audience had been, and still was, attending to all
    that he laid before them. It was frequently the case, especially in
    matrimonial affairs, that the client was listening for a particular piece
    of information and not taking in the whole picture. However, this employer
    evidenced himself to be a model of diligence by the merest lightening of
    his expression at the man's slight whimsy. Thus, coming to the meat of the
    matter, the man continued,</para>

    <para>
      <quote>The subject's first voyage of any length was as a Kornet on the
      Frigate <emphasis>Admiral van Wassenaar</emphasis> from 1855 to 1856.
      During another two-year voyage from 1857 to 1859, also on a Frigate, he
      was promoted to Adelborst. Then he served on the transport ship
      <emphasis>De Heldin</emphasis> which sailed from Hellevoetsluis to the
      West Indies, being promoted to Lieutenant ter Zee der 2e Klasse in 1859.
      In connection with his voyages, he has purchased many charts and maps,
      including of Java, the Batta countries and Sumatra in the East Indies,
      as well as inheriting many maps from his forbears.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>At the age of twenty two he left the navy and began to live
      variously in hotels in Den Haag, Amsterdam and Gouda as well as with his
      brother near Rotterdam. He has made substantial investments using the
      firm of Jonas &amp; Krugeman in Amsterdam, including a particularly
      successful venture in the Koninklijke Stoomboot Maatschappij. He is a
      member of Den Haag Freemason's lodge and The Amsterdam branch of the
      public welfare organisation Maatschappij tot Nut van het Algemeen. He
      has never married and no scandal attaches to his name.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>The man stopped speaking and looked directly at Viruly. An interval
    elapsed during which Viruly tried to formulate his thoughts for the
    response which was clearly expected. In the end he simply said,</para>

    <para>
      <quote>If I understand you correctly, Lieutenant le Fèvre de Montigny
      comes from a lesser branch of a notable patrician family. He is of the
      Nederlandse Hevormde Kerk protestant religion, possessed of some wealth
      and a member of suitably worthy organisations. He has never married and
      has no independent household.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>The man nodded his confirmation. Viruly continued,</para>

    <para>
      <quote>Does he have any particular friends?</quote>
    </para>

    <para>The man knew that not even the smallest grain of the truth must dust
    his answer,</para>

    <para>
      <quote>The subject has an easy social manner which has engaged many
      acquaintances but he has formed no particular friendships. His
      relationship with his brother has endured and indicates that he has the
      potential to form deep and lasting attachments.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>This answer had only skimmed the surface of Viruly's most serious
    concern so he felt that he must press further,</para>

    <para>
      <quote>You say that no scandal attaches to his name but you do not offer
      any more detailed assessment of his character. I should be interested to
      hear your opinion of him as a man.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>The man had prepared his answer, having expected such a line of
    enquiry. He knew that he needed to tread carefully in what he said but
    that say something he must if the fact of his manipulating his information
    were not to be suspected. To reveal too much would, however, put him in
    jeopardy of losing valuable clients and perhaps even put him in the way of
    a more physical sort of danger.</para>

    <para>
      <quote>The subject is a sailor and a bachelor who has been in the habit
      of going where he pleases and suiting himself. Many of his connections
      are people who share his charitable, business and religious interests
      and others are naval colleagues. He is accepted into polite society
      wherever he goes.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>
      <quote>I should perhaps mention that there has lately been an alteration
      in his usual behaviours which might be interpreted as indicating that he
      has come to a time in his life where he is ready to settle down and take
      a wife, should he find someone suitable. For instance, I have heard that
      he has very recently made enquiries as to the purchase of a house
      presently under construction in a fashionable part of The Hague.</quote>
    </para>

    <para>The man left his answer there, knowing that he had avoided the moral
    quagmire before him yet safely achieved the crux of the matter that
    occupied the client before him. He had subtly alluded to the suitability
    and availability of the subject for marriage to the Bisdom van Vliet
    daughter, which was all that Viruly had really wanted to know and what one
    of his other interests had wished him to convey.</para>

    <para>The man made a slight bow and was gone with hardly a disturbance to
    the air in the room. Viruly immediately took up a sheet of writing paper,
    pen and ink and wrote a short message to Marcellus using the form of words
    which they had agreed upon as a confirmation that Paulina's choice of
    husband was considered a suitable one. Sealing the letter, Viruly rang for
    a boy to take it to the post. Marcellus would have the news he was waiting
    for by the end of that afternoon.</para>

    <para>As soon as the message left his hand Viruly began to feel less
    certain of it's content. Now that the man had gone taking his stage
    presence with him, and Viruly had dropped his own guard of rationality and
    returned to being Theo, the concerned brother-in-law, some sense of unease
    crept over him. He tried to focus on what was bothering him but all he was
    left with were vague  suspicions too insubstantial to bear close scrutiny.
    Was the father a noble man who followed his religious convictions at the
    cost of wealth and power, or was he in some way the black sheep of the
    family? Is there some inherited family weakness behind the shadowy figures
    of the uncle known as Jacques and the younger brother, Henri Pieter? For
    all he knew, the latter might have had a dashing military career and been
    killed in action.</para>

    <para>Then there was the man himself. Theo had to admit that he just
    didn't like Johan and that this coloured his enthusiasm for the match with
    Paulina. Quite why his instincts told him to keep his distance from the
    dashing, young Lieutenant he couldn't fathom. Perhaps it was just his own
    fondness for the girl that made it hard for him to see any man as good
    enough for her. Then again, his political and business dealings had been a
    great education in the ways of men and he was well aware that the
    investigator had presented a well-manicured account for political reasons.
    Gillis had some of this skill, too, but Johan seemed to lack this
    political acumen, although he clearly had a head for business which Theo
    was able to appreciate. There was something else that motivated the young
    man in his social dealings, something that Theo felt was beyond his range
    of understanding. Something that was probably best left to the women in
    the family to fathom.</para>

    <para>Once back at Haastrecht, preparations for the luncheon consumed a
    great deal of Paulina's emotional energies. Everything seemed to conspire
    against her, however, and she was often in an agony of anxiety that things
    would not be as she desired or, unthinkably, the invitation would have to
    be postponed or even cancelled. Firstly, her mama had to be persuaded to
    leave Aggie's side and return to Haastrecht for the occasion. It was not
    so much that Maria Elizabeth could not tear herself away from De Haven for
    even one day, although that was the impression that she gave. It was, if
    truth be told, a rather less noble sentiment that motivated her – she had
    moved heaven and earth to find a suitable husband for her youngest
    daughter only to be thwarted by this wilful child. Now, the girl had gone
    and found a man all by herself, putting her mother's nose well and truly
    out of joint. Since Paulina had made it clear that she was taking over all
    her mother's duties in her absence and brooked no interference, she could
    have the responsibility of organising her own luncheon party for all her
    mother cared about it.</para>

    <para>Paulina was delighted to have control of the event but suffered
    greatly until her mother relented and agreed to attend. Then she was on
    tenterhooks waiting for a formal response to their written invitations to
    Johan and Gillis and his wife which was delayed somewhat because the baby,
    Johan Jacob junior, was suffering from some childhood ailment and his
    mother could not bear to be parted from him. At last, the news came that
    all was well so the luncheon could go ahead as arranged. Now Paulina could
    get on with the tasks of planning and organising with which she was in her
    element.</para>

    <para>Wanting to make a good impression, she decided on a formal meal in
    the 'new' part of the house, that is to say the part built by her great
    great great grandfather when he came to Haastrecht in 1694. Usually more
    informal meals were taken in the original 'family house' adjoining it,
    parts of which dated back to the 16th century. Although the family house
    was more cosy and intimate, Paulina wanted her future husband to
    experience the style in which she expected to spend her married
    life.</para>

    <para>Her first task was to decide with the butler on the table setting.
    There was no doubt in her mind but that the Meissen porcelain dinner
    service should be used for she adored it's delicate pink floral pattern
    with a simple gold band around the rim. She had a fondness for porcelain
    in general, fashionably aspiring to a great collection of it one day. To
    accompany the dinner service she chose the solid silver Sheffield cutlery,
    of course. To dress the table she ordered vases of flowers and the
    bringing out the new silver and crystal glass garnishments which she,
    Aggie and Theo had bought for her parents on the occasion of their silver
    wedding anniversary a few years previously. Silver pedestals supported
    crystal fruit platters, compote dishes and
    <emphasis>bonbonnières</emphasis>, their edges dripping with crystal
    tear-drops which would shimmer in the candlelight from the best silver
    candelabra. The tiered centre piece would set off the whole ensemble to
    perfection and leave her guests in no doubt but that they were sitting at
    the table of a well-to-do family. Her next project was to decide on the
    food and wines that would garce her magnificent table setting.</para>

    <para>She hated relying on the staff for advice but soon realized that she
    had to do so. Paulina made a list of her favourite dishes and created an
    opulent but ungainly menu which made cook throw her hands up in despair
    when it reached the kitchen. Cook was not a woman to be beaten, however,
    so she took up her pencil and re-worked Paulina's offering to her own
    satisfaction. Dishes which clashed were separated and those involving
    unseasonable or unobtainable ingredients, as well as those which were
    time-consuming or likely to overtax even her skills, were amended or
    replaced. This revised menu was then taken to the young mistress for final
    approval, the changes being tactfully explained. Luckily, Paulina was
    delighted with the result and had no trouble accepting that she had a lot
    to learn about what went into the creation of a successful menu.</para>

    <para>When it came to choosing the wines to accompany the meal Paulina
    knew from the start that she was out of her depth. She understood that the
    wines served at a dinner were usually judged by the men at least as keenly
    as the table was by the women. The trouble was that she wouldn't know a
    good wine from a bottle of vinegar as she drank but little. In fact, she
    quite disapproved of alcohol but had so far kept this to herself. She had
    seen enough of the effects of drunkenness amongst the poor of the village
    to last a lifetime but was not yet able to disentangle the circumstances
    of poverty and the availability of cheap gin from the ease of plenty and
    the pleasures of fine wines. The only alcohol she allowed to pass her lips
    was the sweet, red vermouth she had been introduced to in Italy a few
    years previously. She realized that this version of a wine was an
    eccentric taste of hers and not something that she could expect her guests
    to drink throughout the meal.</para>

    <para>The French had left behind their habit of wine drinking when they
    retreated back within their own borders in 1815 but the notion of keeping
    a private supply at home had not taken hold with the Dutch. Unlike the hot
    and dry lands of wine-producing France, the wet soil of the Netherlands
    was not conducive to the undermining of buildings with cellars which the
    temperate climate, in any case, rendered unnecessary. Paulina summoned her
    father's favourite wine merchant to discuss placing an order. They went
    through the menu together, the merchant suggesting wines to compliment
    each dish. When the cost of the order was reckoned up Paulina was
    horrified and the whole process had to be gone through again but with an
    eye to economy this time. Somehow she just couldn't bring herself to pay
    the prices of some of the best wines, no matter how much she wished to
    impress her guests.</para>

    <para>All these preparations did not distract her from her duties to the
    family estates. She enjoyed keeping detailed and accurate accounts of all
    the incomings and outgoings, keeping a tight grip on all the monies
    brought to the house by a constant stream of tennants as well as carefully
    monitoring the household expenses. There was also the business of sending
    written instructions to the various tradesmen who were required to make
    repairs and alterations to all the properties. Aside from such routine
    matters, Paulina concerned herself with the physical and moral welfare of
    the sick and poor of the district who either came to the door or were
    commended to her by the predikant. Once word got round that the young
    (and, so it was assumed, inexperienced) woman of the family was in sole
    charge, there was an increase in the number of petitioners but Paulina was
    determined that she should not be hoodwinked into giving charity to the
    undeserving so turned a deaf ear to some of the more outrageous tales of
    woe.</para>

    <para>It was exhausting work which left little time for socializing with
    her good friends Helena and Cornelia Droost and Mientje Blankken, although
    they only lived a step or two away. Letter writing of a personal nature
    was confined to uncharacteristically brief communications with her mother,
    step-sister and a married friend who now lived in Aachen. Her father was
    out of the house most of the time, occupied with his business concerns and
    his civic duties which often involved long hours of travel on top of the
    difficult situations he had to deal with and the important decisions he
    needed to take. In fact, Paulina's most constant companion during this
    period was her journal in which she wrote avidly at every available
    moment, dashing off line after line in her large and flowing hand using a
    pencil for speed rather than the more complex demands of pen and ink. She
    was always to judge that the hhat thoughts which she commited to paper
    during these few weeks in July were the most revealing and significant of
    all her writings.</para>

    <para>The day of the luncheon seemed to come round very quickly so that,
    before she knew it, Paulina was being helped into her best day dress by
    her maid. Her mother and father had both returned to Haastrecht during the
    morning and were now also dressing ready to receive guests. The household
    staff were quietly and calmly going about thier tasks. All was well and
    even the sun was shining for Paulna's luncheon party.</para>

    <para>Marcellus was in his office attending to the post which had
    ccumulated during his brief absence and Paulina and her mother were going
    over the accounts together when their guests arrived by cab from Gouda
    station. By the time Johan, Gillis and Mary had descended from the vehicle
    the Bisdom van Vliet family had made thier way to the vestibule to greet
    them. The sight of Johan almost took Paulina's breath away, which came as
    something of a relief as it woud have been rather socially awkward had her
    feelings towards him suddenly changed.</para>

    <para>The luncheon passed well with both Mary and her mother complimenting
    the tastefully laid table whilst all the men were appreciative of the
    choice of wines. Everyone enjoyed the plentiful food whose many courses
    kept them at the table until well into the afternoon. As to conversation,
    the men had much to talk about since, despite all being liberal in their
    political persuasion, they had somewhat differing views on a number of
    issues which needed debating. Meanwhile, the women talked about children
    and household matters which, having neither, rather left Paulina on the
    outside. Her attention tended to drift towards Johan who deftly included
    her in his audience when he came onto the topic of his passion for the new
    steamships which, he predicted, would replace the use of wind power
    entirely within the next decade. His knowledge of the sea and enthusiasm
    for the new industry of building ships using metal rather than wood and
    engines rather than sail captivated her with his manliness.</para>

    <para>Once the party had eaten their fill, Paulina suggested that they
    took tea or coffee outside in the landscaped grounds across the lane to
    the front of the house. Whilst the ladies made their way to the table and
    chairs which had already been set up in the shade of a large Copper Beech
    tree, the men retired to Marcellus's office where he offered them cognac
    and a choice of cigars from the three factories in Haastrecht. Gillis
    discretely left his brother alone with Marcellus once the comparison of
    cigars and cognacs had been discussed for a polite length of time. He made
    his way slowly through the house and out into the gardens where he found
    the ladies taking their tea cold against the heat of the afternoon, a
    habit from the East Indies which had now become fashionable back in
    Holland.</para>

    <para>The private conversation between Marcellus and Johan did not take
    long. As Marcellus had expected, Johan formally requested his permission
    to pay court to Paulina using the words so carefully coached by brother
    Gillis. Marcellus asked Johan what his prospects were, as if he didn't
    already know, and made out to be modestly rassured by hearing of his
    considerable income from investments, his possible earnings from future
    sea voyages and the building of a fashionable house in Den Haag which
    would make a suitable family home, in due course. Marcellus made a show of
    giving his blessing with the caveat that Paulina herself should be
    agreeable to Johan's attentions, again he was privately sure that she was
    more than willing.</para>

    <para>Once reunited and everyone had drunk their fill of the various
    beverages, Marcellus proposed a stroll in the gardens. This provided him
    with an opportunity to let his guests see in the flesh, as it were, the
    stylish landscaping that they had already admired as the setting for the
    1757 family portrait of great grandfather Theodorus, with his wife and ten
    children. Marcellus privately held this forebear of his to be his role
    model. Theodorus was the first to be appointed burgemeester of Haastrecht
    at the begining of the 18th century, a role which had been handed down
    through the Bisdom van Vliet men in an uninterrupted line ever since.
    Successful in business, Theodorus had been wealthy enough to be able to
    buy up lands around Haastrecht, which included the castle Sloot van Vliet
    which enabled him to engrandise the family name from the simple Bisdom of
    his father, Adriaan. On the home front, Theodorus had built a new wing
    onto the house and commissioned the Royal Gardener to lay out the grounds.
    Then, to top it all, he had fathered twelve children almost all of whom
    had survived to adulthood without the losses in infancy and childhood
    which were usual.</para>

    <para>Marcellus had inherited the family interests at the tender age of
    nineteen and at a time when the Golden Age of Dutch prosperity from
    overeseas trade was long gone. It had been as much as he could do to hold
    onto his inheritance let alone lay out money on house, garden or land. He
    had married Maria when he was thirty three and under some pressure for his
    mother to provide heirs. His fancy was taken by the widow Ledeboer who
    also lived on the Hoogstraat , and who brought lands ajoining his, as well
    as her three surviving children, to their union. As time was to tell,
    Maria's age (she three years older than him) was to lead to
    disappointment. They only had one child, Paulina, and this shortly after
    their marriage in 1839. Now he once more found himself cajoaled by his
    mother, now aged eighty three, into finding a husband for Paulina before
    her child-bearing years had dwindled much further. A male heir was what
    was needed, especially now that Marcellus could feel the economic tide in
    Holland turning to the flood making a second Golden Age seemed possible.
    Today, he felt his hopes rise.</para>

    <para>Whilst Marcellus conducted his guided tour of the lake, the statues
    of Hercules and Neptune and all the specimon trees, Paulina and Johan hung
    back under the pretext of inspecting in the Copper Beeches which Adriaan
    had planted to mark the birth of his first two sons, Jacob in 1696 and
    Theodorus in 1698. The pair pursues their interest in Copper Beeches by
    returning to the small, formal garden behind the house where Adriaan had
    planted his own tree upon first arrival in Haastrecht in 1694. They
    wandered down to the water's edge where the River Ijssel bounded the edge
    of the property. Here, in this public private place, Johan took the
    opportunity to speak his well=rehearsed lines.</para>

    <para>"I do hope that I shall not be presuming too much upon such a short
    acquaintance as ours if i say that I am already at ease in your company.
    Would it be too much to hope that you might one day feel comfortable with
    me?"</para>

    <para>Paulina could hardly keep herself from jumping into the middle of
    his declaration with fulsome affirmations that she reciprocated any
    positive feelings he might have for her. However, she, too, had been
    carefully prepared against the possibility of just this situation
    occuring. So, instead she relied in as steady a manner as she could
    manage,</para>

    <para>" I, too, have felt that there is a naturalness to our
    meetings."</para>

    <para>Taking his cue, Johan responded,</para>

    <para>"Then might I hope that we might meet together more often and get to
    know eachother further?"</para>

    <para>"I should like that very much."</para>

    <para>"Then it will be my pleasure to call upon you as often as you will
    permit me to. In the meantime, I think that it is your birthday soon and
    wish to offer you a gift"</para>

    <para>With this, Johan produced a small package from his inside coat
    pocket and handed it to Paulina.</para>

    <para>"It is just a small token of my esteem which I hope will remind you
    of me when we are apart."</para>

    <para>Paulina unwrapped the present to find a tiny replica of a ship's
    cannon made out of solid silver. Before she could master her feelings she
    felt a flush of disappointment at such an unfeminine choice of gift.
    Hardly had this almost reflex response had time to enter her awareness
    than it was replaced in a more stable delight at his thoughtfulness. It
    also thrilled to have a tangible token of her womanhood, a symbol of her
    passage from unwanted spinster to a woman being paid court to by the man
    she loves. After a heartbeat's delay, Paulina smiled up at Johan and
    offered him her thanks - and her hand hand which he raised to his lips and
    tenderly kissed, holding her gaze with his liquid brown eyes.</para>

    <para>With that, it was done. Paulina Maria Bisdom van Vliet was about to
    be courted by Johan Jacob le Fevre de Montigny. It was hard to think of
    anything else to say now, so the couple just looked into each other's eyes
    for a second or two before turning back to the house where they quietly
    slid back inot the company of their families.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>The last day of June was Paulina's twenty-ninth birthday which made
    for a constant stream of callers to the house. Villagers and tennants came
    bearing the best of their produce that they could manage as a token of
    their respect: fish, meat, eggs, bread, vegetables, fruit, cheese, flowers
    and small pieces of various needlecrafts. Paulina stationed herself on a
    chair behind the streetside window nearest to the main door so that she
    could give a wive of acknowledgement to each departing donor. More
    affluent well-wishers were the cause of frequent deliveries by tradesmen
    and by post of more substantial gifts as well as some of the newly
    fashionable cards. Soon every available space on top of side-boards,
    buffets and small tables was filled, despite the perishables having been
    conveyed to the pantry immediately.</para>

    <para>Among the few callers actually admitted to the house were Paulina's
    friends. First came Helena and Cornelia Droost who lived in the house next
    door. The daughters of a wealthy Schoonhoven silver dealer, there was
    twenty four years difference in the sisters' ages with Helena being
    fourteen years older than Paulina and Cornelia ten years younger. Next to
    arrive was Mientje Blanken, now nearing her fourtieth year, who lived with
    her uncle, an important figure in the village and friend of Paulina's
    father. Last, and in a flurry as usual, was Aaltje van Zijl who was just
    in her twenties and the daughter of another local family of substance.
    Aaltje's father was building the hofje, a courtyard of alms houses, at the
    poor eastside of Hoogstraat. which was a project heartily endorsed by
    Paulina's own father.</para>

    <para>On being shown into the kleine salon each woman kissed Paulina three
    times on alternating cheeks then tendered birthday good wishes. Everyone
    had brought a gift so Paulina was engaged with paper and ribbon for some
    minutes as she revealed writing materials and the latest novel, a pair of
    white lace gloves and a silver-backed hand mirror, which Aaltje assured
    her had come from Paris. Tea and delicate little cakes were served and the
    women fell into comfortable conversation. With these lifelong women
    friends gathered around her, it was not long before Paulina found that she
    could no longer keep her important news to herself;</para>

    <para>"There have been developments in my acquaintace with Lieutenant le
    Fevre de Montigny. I am now officially being courted by this
    gentleman!"</para>

    <para>There was an immediate clamour of excitement and congratulations
    followed by a great press of questions about when, where and how this
    happy circumstance had come about as well as damands for every kind of
    detail about the man himself. Paulina gleefully launched into an
    unnecessarily fulsome account of events and an impassioned description of
    Johan Jacob.</para>

    <para>The two older women had long abandoned any hope of marriage for
    themselves and it was with bitter-sweet feelings that they outwardly
    enthused about Paulina's suitor, having privately considered her to be
    destined to join them in spinsterhood. Cornelia and Aaltje, on the other
    hand, were young and bright with romatntic expectations for thgemselves
    which added a vicarious interest to their enquiries.</para>

    <para>What started out for Paulina as the recounting of her story as if it
    were a fairy-tale romance slowly changed in the telling. Her narrative
    transformed from a description of a girl's cherished dream into a mature
    woman's account of a real man and an actual possibility - no, probability
    - that she would marry him. The atmosphere in the room seemed to gradually
    become more calm, perhaps in response to Paulina's increasingly
    down-to-earth tone. The older women exchanged glances as both privately
    wondered if Paulina might be having second thoughts. But before they had
    time to formulate discrete but probing enquiries, there was a knock at the
    door and a maid came in bearing another gift.</para>

    <para>This present was a rather large package with a long letter in
    Aggie's hand accompanying it. Paulina laid the letter to one side to read
    at her leisure once her guests had departed. She requested the maid to
    clear the table of their now abandoned tea things and, once this had been
    done, laid the parcel on it in order to remove the cord and paper
    wrappings. What was revealed was a bolt of the finest silk satin fabric in
    a stunning magenta. The other women crowded round the table to feel the
    luxuriousness of the material and admire its rare colour. As Paulina
    unrolled the first length of the silk the better for it to be appreciated,
    a small square of paper fell out onto the floor. The maid, who was
    lingering by the buffet too curious to leave the room, swiftly retrieved
    the note from the floorand handed it to Paulina. The contents were a
    brief, intensely private and personal communication which Paulina took in
    at a glance before hastily secreting it beneath the discarded wrapping
    paper. The note read:</para>

    <para>"Dearest Paulina. This is for your bride dress. From your loving
    sister, Aegidia."</para>

    <para>A flush spread up Paulina's neck onto her cheeks and she remained
    quiet and thoughtful as her friends compiled a list of all the features
    which a gown in this most fashionable of colours should have. They began
    to debate hoops as against horsehair petticoats, fringes as against
    ruffles, wide sleeves as against narrow cuffs and whether a lace collar or
    ribbons would be a flattering at the neck-line. In order to give herself
    time to recover her composure, and to dispatch the maid from the room,
    Paulina sent for the latest editions of <emphasis>Le Petit Courrier des
    Dames</emphasis> which Aggie so that the women could persue the
    complicated draperies of the fashionable gowns illustrated therein.</para>

    <title/>
    <para>Johan was enjoying himself hugely. If he had been the sort of man to
    reflect on life then it would have come as a surprise to him that he was
    so pleasurably engrossed in his courtship of Paulina Maria. But he was not
    that sort of man so spared not a second on such thoughts. Instead, he gave
    himself up to the feeling of exhilaration that was the nearest he had ever
    got on land to those times at sea when the ship was creaming along on a
    running sea, sails full and it was his hands on the wheel.</para>

    <para>To begin with he had been a reluctant suitor, already set in his
    bachelor ways at the age of twenty eight. Feeling himself firmly steered
    by both families onto his present course his independent spirit threatened
    to rebel, to fight against their control, with the inevitable result that
    the whole enterprise would have foundered. Disaster was averted, however,
    when the warm winds of flattery swelled his ego and he came round to his
    present and surprisingly comfortable heading. The realisation that he was
    deemed worthy to have his name associated with that of Marcellus Bisdom
    van Vliet, a man whose social stature and good name in business were
    recognise the length of all the Great Rivers, puffed up his pride by
    virtue of association.</para>

    <para>Yet there was more to this change of tack in his courtship of
    Paulina Maria than could be accounted for by mere flattery. Something in
    her response to his attentions spoke directly to a need deep within him,
    although he could not have said what this was. He had simply been going
    through social motions of courtship until a means of extricating himself
    presented itself, but Paulina Maria had been so receptive, so open and so
    guileless in her reception of him that he had been quite won over by her.
    Her obvious delight at everything he said and did drew him to her in
    anticipation of an unbounded and uncritical love such as he had not
    experienced since he was a boy at his mother's knee. That first feeling of
    being loved so completely had ended abruptly upon the birth of his sickly
    younger brother who survived to distract their mother with the burden of
    his care. The untimely death of his father left her an impoverished widow
    struggling to bring up three sons in a manner which befitted their station
    in life. She had precious little emotional energy left for her needy
    second child who was dispatched to school in Hilversum and then into the
    Marine as soon as possible. Only now was that unacknowledged abandoned
    child within the adult Johan awakened to bask in the glow of the generous
    outpouring of adoration lavished upon him by Paulina Maria.</para>

    <para>There had been a lot of women passing through his life since Johan
    entered the Marine as a youth but the pleasures of their company had
    rarely left any lasting impression on him. If he had ever been drawn back
    to any of them it could largely be accounted for by the ease of their
    virtue. Indeed, one of the more pleasant aspects of his residence at the
    Hotel De Zalm was the sweet and available maid-of-all-work who was willing
    to help him unmake his bed in return for the small change he left for her
    on the dresser. But nothing had ever recaptured for him that feeling of
    being loved and wanted without qualification or demands that he had lost
    so early in his life. Until now, that is, and with this most unlikely of
    women who held no more physical attraction for him that which was solely
    due to her sex.</para>

    <para>Again, if he had been a man to ponder such things, Johan would have
    been amazed at himself for the longing he felt for Paulina Maria's
    company. Such was the soothing quality of his time spent with her that,
    had he been able to name the emotion felt upon parting from her, he would
    have called it grief. Paulina Maria never left him to suffer the agony of
    loss for long, however, as she sent him a continuous stream of long
    letters to which he eagerly responded. He often enclosed a new photograph
    of himself in his uniform as he knew this would please her and draw forth
    favourable comments in her next correspondence.</para>

    <para>Thus it was with a glad heart that he viewed the prospect of
    spending several days in her company at the Bisdom van Vliet house in
    Haastrecht. He had arrived on the first Thursday in August to find that
    Marcellus was away from home and not expected back until dinner time the
    next day. Maria Elizabeth was, as usual, much taken up with the affairs of
    the family's local properties and village interests. Paulina Maria
    normally helped her mother with these tasks but had been released from
    most of her duties in order to entertain their guest. The only call on her
    time was the management of the household during Johan's visit, which she
    said it was her pleasure to perform.</para>

    <para>The weather was good on that first afternoon so he spent several
    happy hours with Paulina Maria on his arm as they wandered through the
    <emphasis>overtuin</emphasis> across the lane from the house. They admired
    the new planting which had been done, held imaginary conversations with
    the impressive statues of Hercules and Neptune beside the lake, fancied
    themselves explorers discovering the grotto on its island, then paused to
    look at their reflections in the water and admire the view over the farms
    to the windmills along the Vlist. Turning back towards the house, they
    peeped in at the indoor plants being propagated in orangery but found it
    much to hot and steamy inside to linger there for long.</para>

    <para>They cooled down by taking cordials with Oma under the shade of the
    old copper beech tree in the formal garden behind the house. The old lady,
    now in her eighty-fourth year, had developed a tremor and Johan watched
    tenderly as Paulina Maria helped the old lady to drink from her cup
    without spills. Despite this physical sign of her advanced age, Oma seemed
    keen to show an interest in him and soon got him telling stories about his
    naval exploits. When the couple rose to leave Oma took advantage the
    social <emphasis>largesse</emphasis> granted to those of advanced years
    when delivering her parting shot to the couple,</para>

    <para>"Now don't leave it too long, will you? We need children to keep the
    family going!"</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>As he lay alone in the old-fashioned cupboard bed in his room in the
    <emphasis>familiehuis</emphasis>, old Oma's words came back into Johan's
    head. Up to this point he had only been dimly aware of the connection
    between courtship and marriage, having taken more notice of scandalous
    relationships than the more conventional ones. His courtship of Paulina
    Maria seemed to be a thing in and of itself its destination lost on the
    hazy horizon of the future. Suddenly the mists cleared and he saw with
    crystal clarity that everyone expected him to marry her and father her
    children.</para>

    <para>Gilles had laid out clearly for him the expected progression from
    first meetings to formal application to pay court followed by the
    courtship itself leading up to the making of an offer of marriage. The
    actual goal of being married had, however, remained vague. Johan
    understood that a wedding marked the transition from the groom being an
    unattached bachelor to being a husband bound to one woman for life.
    Perhaps Gilles had rashly assumed that his brother comprehended the state
    of matrimony as well as he did himself, especially as Johan was a frequent
    visitor to Gilles and Maria's home where he could directly observe the
    well-regulated conduct of married life taking place. It might have
    appeared that no further elaboration of the duties and obligations
    involved in being a husband and father was required.</para>

    <para>Thus it was that without a trace of hesitation or doubt Johan
    decided that, yes, he could live permanently with the way Paulina Maria
    made him feel! More than that, he could no longer contemplate life without
    her, the very thought of which now made him rather panic-stricken. Having
    reached the conclusion that he wanted her for his wife, Johan's certainty
    about her feelings for him suddenly began to slowly ebb away allowing the
    reefs of his insecurity to emerge. He drew comfort from the agony of
    uncertainty by snuggling down into a nest of soft mattress, feather
    pillows and voluminous covers. He resolved to ask for her hand as soon as
    an opportunity arose, before she had time to cool towards him. Yes, that
    is what he must do!</para>

    <para>Having resolved on taking this course, Johan's thoughts moved on to
    the topic of children. The connection between sex and unwanted pregnancy,
    not to mention certain unmentionable diseases, had long been familiar to
    him. The link between marriage, sex and the inevitability, and even
    desirability, of procreation was something new for him to contemplate. Now
    he began to toss around the notion of sex for insemination rather than
    simply for pleasure and relief. He began to try to imagine what it would
    be like having conjugal relations with Paulina Maria. It was difficult for
    him to think of her in that way but Oma had made it clear for him that he
    was to stand stallion for the Bisdom van Vliet blood line. He exercised
    his highly developed libidinous faculties to conjure up a vision of what
    lay beneath the chaste layers of Paulina Maria's clothing. He anticipated
    the feel of her naked breasts under his hands, finding them just as he
    liked breasts to be, large yet firm. His member, already tingling
    pleasurably, now stiffened as his imaginings shifted to the warm, moist
    cleft between her legs which promised to welcome him inside. Now
    thoroughly aroused but with no opportunity for casual female company, he
    had no other recourse than to seek the seaman's release.</para>

    <para>Waking sometime later he climbed down from his bed, put on his
    dressing gown and slippers then went in search of the night servant to ask
    for brandy and a cigar to be brought to him. Thus provided for he settled
    into an arm chair set before the open window and shutters. Johan tried
    again to focus his thoughts on marriage and paternity as the night air
    cooled his feverish imagination. He might have reflected upon the
    suffering he witnessed as his parents buried yet another small coffin in
    the Oude Tonge churchyard. Or recalled the distress of his brother,
    Gilles, who could only wait impotently as Maria screamed for a whole night
    and most of the following day to bring his namesake into the world. Or he
    might have brought to mind the young life of his vibrant cousin,
    Elisabeth, cut short in childbirth. As it was he reflected on none of
    these sad events, nor did his lips form a smile at the recollection of the
    joy children could also bring.</para>

    <para>What actually came to his mind was the comforting thought of how
    little the arrival of young Johan Jacob had altered Gillis's daily life.
    He was still able to go about his affairs and travel from home without
    hindrance. His prospective father-in-law was also a re-assuring case in
    point, being hardly ever at home, or so it seemed. Johan would have been
    loathe to curtail his activities for the sake of any child he might
    father, finding it difficult to rest in any one place for long. His
    resolve to marry Paulina Maria would have wavered had he felt his freedom
    of movement might be in any way curtailed. Johan was thus able to
    re-assure himself that he was not about to give up his liberty in any real
    sense but, rather, was about to gain a secure emotional future and a ready
    supply of sex whilst placing himself in an advantageous social position
    into the bargain. Becoming fuddled with alcohol and tiredness, he burrowed
    back into the surprisingly comfortable old bed and was soon snoring fit to
    raise the roof.</para>

    <para>The following day dawned fine and warm, offering Johan the prospect
    of again spending much of it out of doors, as was his preference. He
    missed being on board ship, if not the discipline of life at sea. The day
    was especially full of promise as he was to have Paulina Maria to himself
    for several hours before they would be obliged to join her parents and Oma
    for a family meal. Paulina Maria had appeared at breakfast wearing a light
    gown with a rather lower neckline than was usual for her. The flimsy dress
    in combination with the sheer, almost transparent, fabric of the modesty
    scarf which covered the gap from <emphasis>decolletage</emphasis> to neck
    was enticingly suggestive of the ample bosom beneath, a choice of attire
    which he regrettably attributed entirely to the hot weather and not at all
    to a desire to raise any passion in him.</para>

    <para>Once their coffee and bread had been taken, Paulina Maria announced
    that she wanted him to accompany her to the stables in order to inspect
    the new carriage horse that had been her birthday gift from her parents.
    She suggested that afterwards they might have the horse harnessed to the
    <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> and take a drive along the dyke-top to the
    village of Willige Langerak on the banks of the River Lek. It soon became
    clear to him that horses and horse-drawn transport was a keen interest of
    hers, but unfortunately one that he did not share.</para>

    <para>Perhaps conditioned by his father's ill-humoured old nag, Johan had
    grown up distrustful of horses, finding them alarmingly large, powerful
    and unpredictable. The movement of their gangling legs made his feet ache
    at the very thought of them getting caught between iron-shod hoof and hard
    earth. Their strong jaws and massive teeth threatened to wreak havoc with
    his flesh as their long necks seemed able to rotate their huge heads in
    every conceivable direction, offering little hope of escape. He fancied
    that their bulging eyes followed his every move with nothing but evil
    intent in them, especially when the whites showed. Altogether, he regarded
    the horse as a beast of wilful malevolence which he could not believe
    capable of human subjugation and was thankful that they had no place at
    sea.</para>

    <para>With Paulina Maria's firm grip on his arm, Johan found himself
    propelled towards the stables at a pace which brooked no hesitation.
    Fortunately for the course of their courtship, his equine anxieties soon
    evaporated with the moral heat created by the motion of Paulina Maria's
    breasts which were thrust upwards by her corset and barely concealed by
    the flimsiest of summer fabrics. Not only could he snatch surreptitious
    glimpses of her magnificent <emphasis>decolletage</emphasis> but he could
    also relish the sensation of an occasional brush of clothed breast against
    his upper arm, not to mention the insinuation of a sturdy thigh against
    his as she strode along beside him despite the thickness of her horsehair
    petticoats . All in all he found himself rendered incapable of uttering
    anything coherent, let alone negative, on the subject of horses, being so
    distracted that he could barely follow the thread of her bright chatter.
    In his not trivial experience of women he had learnt that they were all
    too aware of the physical signals they were sending through these slight
    contacts and glimpses of barely concealed flesh. To his delight, Johan
    took Paulina Maria to be flirting with him sexually!</para>

    <para>Once they had arrived at the stables Paulina Maria bade the head
    ostler lead out her new horse. Emerging from the gloom of her stall, the
    animal started at the brightness of the external world causing Johan's
    heart to lurch. The ostler soon calmed the mare with soft words and a
    gentle hand then began to lead her up and down the yard for the admiration
    of her visitors. The animal's coat gleamed in the sunshine, emphasising
    the toned muscles that underlay her supple movements. The delicate way in
    which she placed her feet and her responsiveness to the lightest touch
    from the ostler began to entrance Johan. A tattoo beat out from the man's
    clogs and the beast's iron shoes striking the cobbled ground as the mare
    was put through her paces: walking, turning, trotting and turning to walk
    past them again. Johan began to be mesmerised by the sounds, by the
    oneness of man and mare, and by the sheer beauty and grace of the
    animal.</para>

    <para>Finally the ostler brought the horse to a halt before them making
    her stand so as to be presented to best advantage for their inspection.
    Following Paulina Maria's lead, Johan ran his hand along the animal's
    neck, thrilling to the feel of her firm flesh beneath the warm, velvet of
    her coat. He was given carrot and apple pieces to hold out on the palm of
    his hand for the mare to take. The horse's breath was warm on his skin as
    her soft lips delicately felt for the food before gently lifting it from
    him with a watchmaker's precision. He found himself fascinated by the fine
    skin and few long whiskers of her muzzle, by the pulsating and deep
    nostrils that softly inhaled and exhaled, and by her unfocused brown eyes
    which suggested nothing so much as a benign character. Unable to resist
    exploring her face further, he ran his hand over her forehead, ears, and
    mane before his enchantment was broken by the ostler's discrete
    cough.</para>

    <para>As the mare was led away to be put into harness, Johan turned to
    Paulina Maria and offered her his arm for the return walk to the house. He
    found her gazing into his eyes and smiling contentedly. His heart filled
    with such joy that he could barely stop himself from acting without
    decorum. He wanted to shout, to laugh loudly and to catch Paulina Maria up
    by the waist and run with her. Self-control was necessary as their path
    soon crossed with that of three servants traveling in an open cart with
    whom greetings and cheery waves were exchanged. Paulina Maria explained
    that a picnic was being sent on ahead and would be laid out ready for them
    to take lunch when they got to her father's<emphasis> jachthuis</emphasis>
    in Willige Langerak. What a miracle of organisation she was, thinking of
    everything and arranging it just so! He must have her as his wife!</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>Johan's high spirits soon suffered a knock, however. He readied
    himself to drive out then joined Paulina Maria to wait in the vestibule
    for their transport to be brought to them, Paulina Maria having changed
    into a different and more decorous outfit to suit the upcoming activity. A
    clearly expensive and very ornately decorated <emphasis>sjees</emphasis>
    appeared with a uniformed groom leading the magnificent mare, who was now
    between the delicate shafts of the carriage. Johan found himself fervently
    hoping that he would not be required to take the driving seat. He could
    see that the light, two-seater conveyance had no box for a coachman nor
    was there a pair of horses to suggest that a postilion might appear and
    ride the leader. Johan could barely sit a horse much less drive one so the
    prospect of being put in charge of such a refined and costly rig as that
    drawing up before him filled him with horror. Would Paulina Maria consider
    it unmanly of him were he to decline to take the reins? Could he avoid the
    shame of discovery if he were to conceal his shortcomings behind an
    exhibition of bravado in the driving seat? Images of every sort of
    carriage accident known to him passed before his mind's eye causing his
    courage to take flight. A paralysis seized him such as he had never known
    even in the worst of conditions at sea.</para>

    <para>It was with a not inconsiderable measure of relief that Johan
    realised that Paulina Maria was heading determinedly for the left seat in
    the <emphasis>sjees</emphasis>. Hastily mastering himself, Johan helped
    her up into the carriage then walked round to the right side and climbed
    in himself. Once they were settled, sitting close together as dictated by
    the lack of space, Paulina Maria signalled to the man at the horse's head
    that they were to set off. Soon they were on their way through the village
    and onto the Vlisterdijk road towards Shoonhoven and it was only then that
    she explained the rather unconventional seating arrangement as only
    prudent with a relatively untried horse which had never pulled a
    <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> before or been driven by anyone in the
    household apart from herself and her father. She wished to spare Johan the
    responsibility of driving in these circumstances and hoped that he would
    not be offended. He was not, he assured her, managing to present a
    graceful acceptance of the imposed circumstances which avoided his having
    to confess his shortcoming as a suitor.</para>

    <para>As they passed slowly and sedately along the Hoogstraat, the men
    they passed doffed their hats and women dipped little curtsies. Johan was
    unaware of it but their route out of the village carefully avoided the
    poorer dwellings to the east of the Grote Haven in favour of passing the
    best houses and the thriving businesses. Just beyond the village they came
    in sight of an octagonal windmill which Paulina Maria named for him as
    Boezemmolen Number Six, which seemed a rather prosaic name for the
    gracefully curved structure with its reed thatch top coat and almost
    rakish 'tail' ladder. Looking ahead Johan could make out six or seven more
    windmills along the River Vlist, although these were of a smaller, simpler
    design. He remarked that the land below the dijk seemed still quite
    waterlogged, even after the recent dry spell, voicing some surprise that
    none of these drainage mills had their sails turning despite a reasonable
    breeze having got up. Paulina Maria explained that one of the other duties
    of the servants in the cart ahead of them had been to instruct the millers
    to stop the sails until their <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> had passed. The
    Gouda to Schoonhoven Post Coach had also been held back to let them go on
    ahead of it as well as any vagrants or beggars cleared out of their
    path.</para>

    <para>The way having been prepared for them, the journey passed most
    pleasantly. Johan had all the mills and farms named for him and anecdotes
    told about the local characters who inhabited them. It soon became clear
    to him that Paulina Maria and her mother not only controlled all that he
    could see with a firm business hand, they also took an interest in the
    lives of their tenants. Families suffering sickness and hardship received
    assistance so that none should be destitute through no fault of their own.
    Although Paulina Maria did not talk about this, he soon deduced for
    himself how delicate the balance between water, wind and land was. As high
    tides and heavy rainfall raised water levels in the River Vlist, which ran
    between the larger rivers of the Ijssel and Lek and drew water from both
    of them, the land would flood. If the wind to turn the mills did not come
    then it would not be possible to pump the water off the land so it would
    remain waterlogged. Animals would die, crops would fail and diseases
    thrive in the stagnant water so that all who drank from it risked illness
    and even death. Being at the mercy of wind and water was something he
    could understand and came as a welcome antidote to the earlier social
    shortcomings he had felt. It was just a pity that the mill arms had their
    canvasses rolled up as he would have enjoyed hearing the rush of the sails
    as the wind gave up its power to them and the wood of the mill structures
    creak and groan in response to the motion.</para>

    <para>His equilibrium restored, Johan now took advantage of their close
    physical proximity and the time on their hands to pay attention to his
    courtship of Paulina Maria. He began with the usual compliments on
    appearance: the colour of her carriage dress bringing out the colour of
    her eyes, the attraction of the fineness of her complexion, the inviting
    shape and colour of her lips, and so on. He leant close to her so that he
    could speak softly into her ear whilst considering how to slip his arm
    around her waist, a liberty which would allow him to explore the corsetry
    beneath her dress for its hints about the flesh beneath. She seemed to
    accept his attentions with some warmth yet she did not respond physically
    as he had anticipated she might, so he held back from pressing her too far
    for fear of rejection. He fancied that Paulina Maria was only feigning her
    concentration on driving out of decorum, regarding himself as fortunate
    that she had her hands full with the horse's reins and was constrained to
    be close to him by the confines of the carriage.</para>

    <para>Passing what seemed to be the last mill before coming to a village,
    Johan rallied his interest as Paulina Maria told him about it. His
    attentiveness was part courtship ploy as well as a half genuine enquiry
    and turned out to be successful on both counts as the mill's long history
    was recounted with some enthusiasm. The current Bonrepasmolen, he was
    told, was the latest to be built on the site of the earliest mill in South
    Holland, with the collapse of the access bridge and loss of wind dogging
    the one attempt made to re-locate the mill to the opposite side of the
    Vlist. Hearing them approaching, Miller Prins came out of the
    reed-thatched pyramid of a house that he and his family occupied beneath
    the wooden cap of the mill and proudly held up his baby son, Arie, for the
    lady and her guest to admire. Paulina Maria caused the
    <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> to be halted briefly, producing a coin from
    some concealed place in her skirts which she instructed Johan to give to
    the miller. This achieved, they continued with their journey and, to his
    joy, Paulina Maria leant conspiratorially towards Johan. This was for
    nothing more romantic than to quietly explain that she wished to
    discourage Miller Prins from presenting the child at the house since he
    was unlikely to resist using the occasion as an excuse to petition her
    mother and herself for money to enlarge the mill's house to accommodate
    his growing family. It was the view of her parents that the miller was
    lucky to have work and a home so should be grateful not greedy. Lacking
    any grounds to contradict her, Johan joined the whispered conspiracy
    against the miller as the only way he could see to pursue his
    courtship.</para>

    <para>Their destination was soon in view as the Vlist swung round to pass
    the village of Willige Langerak to their right. Leaving the dijk, they
    turned down beside the church before taking a narrow lane to their left
    and halting the <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> before the door of a long, low
    house. An elderly man appeared from within, followed by the three
    Haastrecht servants, all four lining up to welcome them. Johan hastily
    stepped down from the carriage and hastened to assist Paulina Maria ahead
    of the waiting staff. Although the <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> was
    extremely well sprung and deeply upholstered he was relieved to be able to
    straighten his body and stretch his long legs. Paulina Maria introduced
    the old man as Jan de Gier who acted as caretaker of the
    <emphasis>jachthuis</emphasis> then invited Johan to enter the house with
    her. Once inside Paulina Maria disappeared into a distant room along with
    her maid and he was shown to his own room where Jan de Gier's son was on
    hand to help him to make himself comfortable and clean after the dusty
    journey.</para>

    <para>The refreshment provided with lunch was most welcome and Johan
    partook of several glasses of an excellent Spätburgunder with which to
    wash down a hearty serving of cold meats, cheeses and filled breads from
    the buffet awaiting them. He noticed that Paulina only drank seltzer water
    but made up for this abstemiousness with a hearty appetite for the food,
    especially the sweet dishes which were brought in once they had finished
    with the savouries. By the time they had eaten their fill they had been
    more than an hour and a half at table, the time being consumed in no small
    part by the passage of easy conversation between them. Nevertheless Johan
    was starting to feel restless and was pleased to follow up on a talking
    point by suggesting a stroll to the nearby church.</para>

    <para>On leaving the <emphasis>jachthuis</emphasis> they turned right
    along the lane for the short walk to their destination, glad of the shade
    of the few trees at the edge of the gardens as the heat of the day reached
    its mid-afternoon intensity. The low body of the church was painted white
    with the addition of a short, square, tower at its western end built in
    grey stone, the whole looking very neat and well-kept. As they approached
    the portico over the entrance hall the Pastor, having heard them coming,
    appeared round the corner from the graveyard with the intention of opening
    the doors for them and assisting them in any further way they might
    require. However, Paulina Maria deftly dismissed the man saying that she
    was sufficiently familiar with the interior of the church. Johan was
    thankful for her tact as he so desperately wanted to have her completely
    to himself at last with nothing to distract her from his
    attentions.</para>

    <para>In the cool of the interior they made a brief tour of inspection of
    what little there was to see in this simple place of worship, relaxing
    some of their social guardedness in response to the calm atmosphere that
    often characterises old churches and is so soothing to the spirit. Johan
    chose a bench by the wall and drew Paulina Maria to sit beside him where
    they were companionably and contentedly silent for a while. Then Johan
    gently took her hand and lifted it briefly to his lips before
    asking;</para>

    <para>"Would you do me the honour of considering becoming my wife?"</para>

    <para>He had not exactly planned to propose in this place and at this
    time, but it had been on his mind to speak to Paulina Maria as soon as he
    had the opportunity. He rather fancied that she might wish to take time to
    consider the matter especially as he was starting to realize that there
    were differences between them. He worried that she might reject him since
    it was becoming obvious that their lives took different paths with his
    being so unlike that of her father that she might not be able to
    accommodate his ways. Although he badly needed to make certain of her, he
    was actually somewhat unnerved by her immediate acceptance of his offer of
    marriage. Had she really thought the matter over? Would she change her
    mind later and break their engagement on further reflection?</para>

    <para>Johan now sought to ease his insecurity by suggesting that their
    nuptials should take place as soon as possible, a course of action to
    which Paulina Maria instantly agreed. He and his new fiancée sat together
    in the old church, talking together in hushed tones as they planned how to
    make their important announcement and when the wedding should take place.
    Everything went smoothly as Paulina Maria knew exactly what was needed and
    soon put her organisational skills to work, relieving him of much of the
    detailed decision-making, for which he was ill-equipped anyway. By the
    time they left the church Johan knew exactly what he was to do and when in
    making the announcement of their forthcoming marriage to their respective
    families and friends.</para>

    <para>Although the success of his suit brought an immediate feeling of
    relief and even satisfaction, he still felt a vague sense of unease. It
    would seem that Paulina Maria had already secured the blessing of her
    family in anticipation of his proposal yet he wondered why they had not
    found a better match for her than his unworthy self. Somehow it had all
    been too easy, leaving him with the suspicion that he had overlooked some
    flaw in the Bisdom van Vliet's in general or Paulina Maria in particular.
    Or was it simply that they had not seen through him despite their worldly
    wisdom? A new anxiety began to form in his mind to replace his earlier
    fear of rejection. As the couple made the return journey to Haastrecht by
    <emphasis>sjees</emphasis> the notion slowly crystallised in his kind that
    Paulina Maria's family were about to give him a place among them solely by
    virtue of their own misguidedness. If they knew him for the undeserving
    wretch that he really was then he would not be about to occupy the exalted
    position of Paulina Maria's husband. He had secured entry to their
    patrician family through marriage but was unworthy of it and now felt the
    cold fingers of insecurity again reaching for his heart.</para>

    <title/>

    <para>As the Bisdom van Vliet family gathered before dinner on Friday 6th
    August Johan was pleased to announce that he and Paulina Maria were to be
    married as soon as everything could be put in place. Her family were
    delighted although the women were at first somewhat perturbed that there
    was to be no formal period of engagement with all its associated social
    and sartorial benefits, not to mention the jewelery. Then Marcellus voiced
    the view that the couple were old enough to know their own minds and any
    undue delay would serve no useful purpose - a view no doubt bolstered by
    the brisk and businesslike approach he and Maria had taken towards their
    own wedding. Soon all concerns were put aside and a toast made to the
    betrothed pair.</para>

    <para>The discussion during the meal concluded with an almost military
    plan of action having been drawn up. Throughout that evening and the
    following day messengers came and went and the house bustled with constant
    activity and buzzed with hasty consultations. Johan found himself swept
    along on the tide of activity, collapsing exhausted into his bed that
    night with no energy left with which to worry about anything. There seemed
    very little that he could actually contribute apart from his general
    enthusiasm for all that was going on around him and participation in any
    necessary formalities. His only personal task was to write to his brother
    with the good news and an invitation for Gillis and Mary to dine at
    Haastrecht that Sunday evening. Their hearty congratulations and
    acceptance of the dinner invitation came by immediate return.</para>

    <para>In what seemed like no time at all the official procedures began
    with a visit to the Raadhuis for the Huwelijksafkondigingen which publicly
    proclaimed their wedding in writing. There was some urgency in doing this
    as it was required that their should be two weeks for any objectors to
    come forward before the actual wedding day itself. The next day they
    attended Sunday morning service in the Hervormde Kerk for the announcement
    of their wedding to the congregation. The Pastor was a friend of
    Marcellus's so had already visited the house and, over refreshments, a
    relaxed and happy discussion of the detailed wedding arrangements had
    resulted in Johan and Paulina Maria emerging with a clear idea of what was
    to happen. Being the Burgermeester, Marcellus himself had organised the
    civil marriage ceremony in the Raaadhuis that would precede the Church
    wedding, the date set for both ceremonies being August 20th.</para>

    <para>Although Johan was familiar with the exterior of the church, whose
    brick tower topped with a three-tiered white belfry dominated the village
    skyline, he had never been inside. The family had explained that this was
    not the original building as this had been destroyed by fire and rebuilt
    twice since its 13th century foundation. The last reconstruction in the
    17th century had left the old choir section outside the walls which
    resulted in an unusual T-shaped interior. He had been shown the base of
    the choir walls and the grave stones covering its vaults which were now
    open to the elements and to public use. Now, as they entered the church,
    Marcellus and Paulina Maria took him aside in order to show him the Bisdom
    van Vliet family vault. Beneath the looping script and decorative
    curlicues carved into the stone covering the vault lay the remains of
    Paulina Maria's ancestors. The rather chilling thought that he could well
    join them was a rather sobering thought.</para>

    <para>As he joined the family in their accustomed pew Johan was acutely
    aware that he was the object of barely concealed scrutiny by the church
    goers gathered in the rows behind them. His presence at the house on
    Hoogstraat could hardly have gone unremarked in such a small and
    close-knit community as Haastrecht and the gossip surrounding himself and
    Paulina Maria must have been rife. So, when the Pastor made the
    announcement that their marriage was to take place in less than two week's
    time a breaking wave of whispers and rustling clothing broke across the
    congregation. Johan felt their eyes upon him as he turned towards Paulina
    Maria and they exchanged smiles. Once the service was over the Bisdom van
    Vliet family party were the first to leave the church but nevertheless
    found themselves waylaid by well-wishers and the just plain curious,
    causing them to be considerably delayed on their return to the
    house.</para>

    <para>After a hasty lunch everyone but Johan resumed their busy wedding
    preparations. Lingering at the table with a much-needed glass of wine to
    hand he struggled with a cross-current of emotions. He had been caught up
    by the general excitement of the wedding announcement and the press of
    people outside the church but now found that the celebratory mood this had
    induced in him seemed to be shared neither by his bride-to-be nor by his
    hosts who all now adopted a cool, businesslike demeanor. A sense of not
    being part of the whole process of organising the marriage - his marriage
    - and of being relegated to the side-lines was at odds with wanting to
    share his happiness. Soon he took his lifelong recourse from the feeling
    of being abandoned and went in search of some independent activity in
    which he could bury himself. Since Marcellus had offered him the use of
    his library and workroom it was to this secluded place that Johan
    retreated with a view to reading the newspapers for the day.</para>

    <para>At first he just skipped through the news without taking much in as
    he was not in a settled enough frame of mind to undertake the onerous task
    of reading about national and provincial politics. Suddenly his eye was
    taken by a small item that immediately captured his full attention since
    it concerned a lady with whom he had some acquaintance. Back in 1861 he
    had been serving on a ship making passage between Den Haag and Alexandria
    in the company of three ladies who, much to the irritation of the officers
    and crew, they had been ordered to convey in the best possible comfort.
    The youngest, Alexine Tinne, had attained some notoriety as a pioneering
    photographer and fearless traveller. She was also among the wealthiest
    women in the Netherlands. Accompanied by her widowed mother, her maternal
    aunt, their several maids and a vast amount of luggage, accommodating them
    had caused serious disruption on board. Although only a few years his
    senior and not unpleasing to look on, Vrouw Tinne did not attract him in
    the usual way. For one thing, her mode of dress was nothing short of
    bizarre and for another she had about her a steely determination to go her
    own way in the world which quite threatened the young officer.</para>

    <para>Much had been forgiven her, however, when she began to enlivened
    dinners in the officers quarters with her vivid accounts of her
    experiences whilst travelling through Egypt, Palestine and Syria as well
    as of her time living in Beirut, all of which were regarded as territories
    too dangerous for a woman to enter. The officers were all enchanted by her
    description of her planned expedition in search of the source of Nile, a
    feat attempted by few men let alone by woman, and one which they all
    secretly wished they could undertake. Once back in Holland he had hastened
    to acquire the maps and charts which would enable him to see where she was
    about to venture, spending endless hours trying to work out her possible
    routes and imagining the hazards and wonders she would encounter along the
    way. Over the next few years he bought every book and paper published
    about her expeditions and pieced together a dismaying tale of abandoned
    hopes as the river proved unnavigable and illness struck. Vrouw Tinne's
    mother, aunt and two of her maids died during her second attempt to
    penetrate the heart of Africa and she had been very ill herself. Privately
    he considered it a tribute his idea of feminine correctness that they had
    continued to keep up their Dutch standards of toilette and domestic
    routine in the face of such a hostile environment.</para>

    <para>Now he was disturbed to read that Vrouw Tinne had disappeared during
    her latest expedition, along with two Dutch sailors who were part of her
    <emphasis>entourage</emphasis>. Her caravan had set out some weeks
    previously with the intention of crossing the Sahara desert in order to
    encounter the nomadic Tuareg tribes. She seemed to have made contact with
    some tribal leaders upon arriving safely at Marzuk but since then nothing
    had been seen or heard of her. She had failed to make contact with a
    fellow explorer in the area who had set up a rumour that fleeing survivors
    from her caravan told of an ambush and many deaths. Vrouwe Tinne's safety
    was feared for, in short. Johan wanted to see for himself what kind of
    geographical location she might be in and the physical challenges she was
    facing. He got up and began to look through the cupboards and bookshelves
    in the hope of an atlas to help him in his quest.</para>

    <para>At the fourth try he opened a cupboard to find the welcome sight of
    three rows of the familiar tubes of twenty or so rolled-up maps which
    Marcellus had neatly arranged inside. Johan reverently lifted them out one
    by one, unrolling each in turn on the top of the large table in the centre
    of the room, holding down their four corners with convenient small, heavy
    objects. Thus he took stock of the treasure he had found, carefully
    rolling each map up and replacing it in the cupboard as he finished with
    it. There was, of course, nothing on Africa but instead a wealth of
    material relating to Holland in general and to the Krimpenerwaard in
    particular, some of it familiar from his own collection and even some of
    the work of his grandfather. Several river charts took his interest as
    either very old or for their obvious use as working documents which had
    been annotated in the process of taking water management decisions. After
    some deliberation, he chose one from among them for closer
    scrutiny.</para>

    <para>He reverently laid out what he recognised as a hand-coloured print
    on paper made from a copper engraving of the original chart as drawn by
    Melchior Bolstra in the middle of the last century. He knew that it was
    one of a set of seven sheets which covered the whole of the River Lek,
    part of a mapping exercise which covered all the rivers of Holland. This
    particular sheet showed the reach of the river that passed Willige
    Langerak, a village which now held sentimental interest for him. Only
    forty or so copies of Bolstra's maps had been produced, their ownership
    restricted to officials of the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland and the
    local river and polder boards. None had been allowed into general
    circulation and many were now lost from sight. Marcellus's forbears had
    clearly been involved in the making of important decisions about the
    management of the Lek which were to prove successful in preventing the
    repeated flooding that had occurred since the Spyk dyke breach in 1740.
    The map had also been used in their deliberations about work on the bed of
    the river which would ensure that it remained an efficient navigation
    route for shipping.</para>

    <para>Bolstra had undertaken a meticulous survey of the Lek between 1750
    and 1754, following the principles introduced by Cruquius which combined
    rigorously gathered quantitative data with the usual cartographic drawing.
    Unlike Croquius, Bolstra did not keep his data in separate tables but
    integrated it into the chart itself to produce an accurate representation
    of the river bed and the other topographical elements of the fluvial
    environment. Johan knew that, although Bolstra had amassed data concerning
    the depth of the river and the shape of the river bed, he was yet to
    develop the system of contour lines. He was also aware that the results of
    Bolstra's research into river flow were never applied to the chart,
    although they had been available in manuscript form. Rather less of a
    shortcoming in Johan's view was the lack of detail included about the land
    beyond the river and its banks and dykes, a focus on navigation by water
    which showed the map-maker to be of like minds with himself.</para>

    <para>After some moments in silent appreciation of the history of the
    chart before him, Johan delved into the breast pocket of his coat and
    removed a square pouch made of soft leather from which he carefully slid
    his folding brass magnifying glass. He opened the glass out so that it
    rested on its frame with the lens at just the right height to bring the
    details of the chart into focus. Now he bent to the happy task of reading
    the old chart before him, as others might read a sheet of music or a good
    book. In his blood ran the gift of visualising mere lines on paper as the
    very thing that they had been made to represent. So, the territory mapped
    rose in his minds eye as a three-dimensional landscape, coloured and in
    motion as nature and man had made it. Not only that but he could move
    about in this inner world: altering course here and altitude there,
    compensating for wind and current, avoiding the precipice and finding the
    track most economical of effort. Then, at will, his perspective would
    shift back to the drawing before him and a course to run would appear to
    him as clearly as if the line to follow had already been drawn upon the
    paper.</para>

    <para>Now he saw, as if he were there, the river gently curving to port
    before him as it flowed towards the sea, the low water lazy at the turn of
    a neap tide and depleted by the summer sun. To starboard he perceived the
    pattern of ditches, walls and triangular bastions that made up the
    six-pointed defensive star that protected Nieuwpoort against artillery
    attack. Ahead and to port rose Schoonhoven's larger,
    eight-pointed<emphasis> trace italienne</emphasis> fortifications beyond
    which the river made a turn to starboard before evaporating at the western
    edge of the chart. He could see that, as well as protecting against attack
    by man, these ramparts would save both cities from floods, the harbours
    and shipyards tucked behind them providing refuge for shipping.</para>

    <para>Having looked around him in a general way, Johan now turned his
    attention to the north bank just before Schoonehoven where the village of
    Willege Langerak lay tucked behind a shallow dyke. He passed across the
    shallows at the edge of the river and floated up and over the dyke to the
    gratifying sight of the church with its tower ahead of him looking almost
    exactly as it had a century later on. The gentlest of smiles warmed his
    face at the recollection of the day that he had spoken to Paulina Maria
    within with such a happy outcome. Turning to look at what was now
    the<emphasis> jachthuis</emphasis> he found instead two ramshackle
    cottages and was reminded of the Bisdom van Vliet's wealth which had
    enabled these mean dwellings to be transformed into the well-appointed
    hunting lodge and stables that he had visited.</para>

    <para>Having made his sentimental journey to Willige Langerak he floated
    over fields and dykes to Schoonhoven itself where he became engrossed in
    exploring the harbour and waterways that were so much a part of the old
    city, losing himself in how life was before the steam engine and the river
    improvements. The weight of a hand on his shoulder roused Johan to the
    present and to Paulina Maria beside him.</para>

    <para>"We thought we had lost you, nobody has seen you for hours! I'm glad
    that we could provide you with something to occupy you and only sorry to
    have to disturb you, but it is time to dress for dinner. Your brother and
    our other guests are expected shortly."</para>

    <para>Johan took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and looked in
    disbelief at the time.</para>

    <para>"Thank you for coming to find me, my dear. I shall just replace this
    chart then go to make myself ready for our celebration dinner."</para>

    <para>He took Paulina Maria's hand and raised it to his lips, causing her
    a slight giggle at the tickle of his moustaches, then turned to roll up
    Bolstra's chart. Paulina Maria filled with a warm glow as she took in the
    curve of his strong back bent over the table. Next he went about the
    business of placing the chart among its fellows in their cupboard. She
    could barely resist reaching out to touch his beautiful dark hair. Order
    restored to the maps, he turned towards her and they fell into an
    unpremeditated mutual embrace, heedless of the possibility of being
    observed.</para>

    <para/>

    <para>Paulina Maria was wearing her new Bride Dress for the first time
    that evening. As Johan returned to her side, dressed for dinner and ready
    to receive the congratulations of their guests, he complimented her on it
    fulsomely, although privately he wondered at her choice of such a bold hue
    which was a surprisingly fashionable choice for her. Although her
    complexion could stand up to the colour, the gown itself was so busy with
    every form of adornment that it quite swamped even Paulina Maria's robust
    frame and owed its design to no form of fashion that he knew of. He
    suspected Paulina Maria's own whims had steered its creation and quailed
    somewhat at the thought that she would be wearing this same garment to all
    their engagements between now and the end of the honeymoon, and that it
    would live on in perpetuity in their wedding photographs. He would now
    have to reconsider wearing his full dress uniform for their big day as
    Paulina Maria's gown would undoubtedly distract everyone's attention from
    it.</para>

    <para>As the guests for their dinner party began to arrive and assemble in
    the Grote Salon Johan was introduced to Marcellus' brother, Otto Braet
    Bisdom van Cattenbroek, and his wife, Adelaide. Paulina Maria's uncle, who
    was called Braet by everyone, seemed a rather dull old chap compared to
    the cheery and sociable Marcellus. Despite being Marcellus's younger
    brother by four years Braet's hair was quite grey. His heavy eyelids
    drooped as though weary of looking at the world and his mouth came to rest
    with its corners turned down in lamentation of his lot in life. From the
    conversation amongst the Bisdom family Johan gathered that Uncle Braet was
    an Advocate of some importance in the city of Utrecht and had taken the
    van Cattenbroek name from his lands a few miles upstream along the
    Hollandse Ijssel near the city of Montfoort. It seemed to Johan that Uncle
    Braet had got himself out from under the shadow of his prominent sibling
    by removing himself from South Holland to Utrecht and its Province,
    altering his name to simply Braet van Cattenbroek and seeking prominence
    in a different public sphere.</para>

    <para>By contrast, Vrouw van Cattenbroek appeared to be much younger being
    possessed of an open, round face which displayed few signs of a care-worn
    personality. Her buxom figure and straight brown hair were simply dressed
    giving an air of motherliness about her. Just as Gillis and Mary had named
    their first-born Johan Jacob after him so Braet and Adelaide had named
    their firstborn after Paulina Maria. This youngest Paulina Maria was now
    in her twenty-first year so it seemed a shame that she had not been
    invited that evening. He lost count of their other children who were
    mostly girls with the only boy he registered being ten-year-old 'Freddie'.
    He found all the talk around him was of children which was rather tedious
    and he idly wondered if his view of them would change when his own arrived
    on the scene. For now, though, he was reduced to making polite noises as
    his mind attempted to desert to more interesting matters. He had even more
    of a struggle to keep up appearances when the women of the party began to
    make admiring comments about Paulina's Bride Dress and invited him to
    agree with them. He was never so grateful as when the butler announced
    that dinner was to be served.</para>

    <para>A few glasses of wine and he began to feel more relaxed, although he
    felt he could contribute little of substance to the dinner table talk.
    Everyone wanted to know the details of the wedding, the wedding party, the
    honeymoon and where they planned to establish their home. On most topics
    he was as uninformed as all the other guests and learned a lot from the
    Paulina Maria's account of what was planned. It appeared was his task to
    arrange the honeymoon but it had come as quite a shock to him that he was
    expected to have this well in hand already when, in fact, he had given it
    no thought until now. He tried to hide behind a wish to keep it a secret
    from Paulina Maria but nobody believed that such a thing was possible so
    he was forced to make a plan on the spur of the moment. He remembered
    Paulina Maria showing him her albums from the coach trip she had made
    through the Alps to Italy and how enthusiastically she talked of the
    water, flora and fauna she had seen along the way. Inspired by the notion
    of water, he broadly hinted that they would be visiting the Mediterranean
    in the South of France before passing through to the lakes of Italy and
    Switzerland. To his great relief this suggestion clearly pleased and
    excited Paulina Maria so met with general approval. He only hoped that he
    would be able to make good on what was now taken to be his promise.</para>

    <para>Paulina Maria and Marcellus were had already compiled a list of
    guests for the wedding party to which Gillis and Johan had contributed as
    many of names of family, friends and professional that they could think
    of. The Tivoli in Utrecht, owned by another of Marcellus's friends, had
    been chosen as the most suitable venue for this prestigious event. The
    city had good water, rail and road links across the Netherlands, Germany
    and Belgium with plenty of respectable accommodation to be had. The Tivoli
    consisted of an attractive park within which a grand hall had recently
    been built as an improved venue for the concerts that the gardens were
    known for. The replacement of the old wooden concert hall with a larger,
    stone-faced building now meant that this Grote Zaal had attained a
    reputation for hosting grand events, such as the 50th anniversary
    masquerade of the Utrecht university in 1868. Thus it was considered by
    the family to have the right pedigree for such a significant occasion as
    the marriage of Marcellus and Maria Bisdom van Vliet's only daughter which
    needed to be socially conspicuous.</para>

    <para>A scheduling problem had then arisen because the guest list was so
    long that it would require two separate sittings in order to accommodate
    everyone. Paulina Maria had therefore decided that two identical wedding
    parties would be held on consecutive days but this was not easy to arrange
    as the hall had other bookings and the caterers needed time to prepare. In
    the end she arranged that the wedding parties should take place on the
    Monday and Tuesday preceding the formal ceremonies scheduled for Friday
    the twentieth. She anticipated that they would depart for their honeymoon
    on Saturday the twenty-first, an idea which Johan did not disabuse her of.
    Once again, Johan was impressed be her ability to organise matters,
    especially as she already had preparations well in hand for the dual
    parties which were now only just over week away. Uncle Braet roused
    himself to give his blessing to the choice of the Tivoli venue and to
    offer the family accommodation for the duration of their stay in Utrecht
    as well as volunteering his wife's local knowledge of the best catering
    suppliers.</para>

    <para>By the end of the meal Johan's head was swimming with information,
    as well as the various wines and spirits which he had sampled. It was no
    wonder that the house had been such a hive of activity since he and
    Paulina Maria had made their announcement. He could now see why Paulina
    Maria had made no time for him and could appreciate what a remarkable
    amount she had achieved in only a short time. He was now to return to Den
    Haag with Gillis and Mary and he was glad of some quiet time alone with
    his own people, finding it was relaxing to be able to be calm with them as
    a respite from the whirlwind of the dinner party. They were concerned that
    matters were moving too fast for him, despite wishing to see the match
    settled in short order. Johan confessed that his head was spinning at the
    scale and speed of what felt like a military operation set in train to the
    end of a rather more splendid wedding than he could ever have envisaged,
    but he did not want to change anything. He could adjust to the situation
    and was already starting to think about how he could play his own,
    distinctive part in it all.</para>

    <title/>

    <para>The man considered it a sound investment to spend a few days working
    at a menial task for poor payment whilst enduring the bullying tirades of
    the nasty little chap who considered himself to be his superior. He
    laboured away fetching and carrying everything from heavy tables to the
    starched white cloths that would cover them, from boxes of silver cutlery
    to delicate floral arrangements, from crates of Champagne to trays of the
    fragile glasses from which it would be drunk. Then the pace changed as the
    tables were dressed and the places set with a military regularity that was
    checked with a measuring stick to ensure perfect spacings and alignments.
    Once the Tivoli's <emphasis>grote zaal</emphasis> had been laid out to the
    exacting standards of the overseer, the hired help were given time to rest
    and eat a basic meal of bread and cheese washed down with water or milk
    that was not provided out of any concern for the workers' welfare but from
    the necessity of discouraging them from helping themselves from the food
    and drink intended for the banquet.</para>

    <para>After being sent away to clean themselves up and put on the uniforms
    that would transform them from workmen into stewards, their next task was
    to greet the guests, surreptitiously checking that they were
    <emphasis>bona fide</emphasis> before showing them to their proper places.
    Two long tables ran the length of the <emphasis>grote zaal </emphasis>from
    the slightly raised top table which stretched across the head of the room.
    In the centre of the top table and right opposite the main doors so that
    it was the first thing the guests would see as they entered the
    <emphasis>room</emphasis> was the grand 'throne' upon which the bride and
    groom would sit beneath its fragrant canopy of pine branches which
    symbolised the evergreen nature the marital bond. Someone had put
    considerable diplomatic effort into the seating plan for the two long
    tables, making sure that the most important guests were seated in their
    proper order of importance whilst avoiding <emphasis>cliques</emphasis> or
    uncomfortable clashes of interests or personalities. So, it had been
    impressed upon the stewards that no changes of place whatsoever were to
    occur, either by accident or design.</para>

    <para>Although there was still an hour or more to go before the event was
    due to start, well-dressed men and women were already arriving and milling
    about the gardens. Whilst his colleagues were content to wait at the doors
    to the <emphasis>grote zaal</emphasis> for guests to approach them, the
    man set about unobtrusively identifying the wanderers and the new
    arrivals, shepherding them towards the stewards at the doors without them
    noticing either him or his influence upon them. His invisibility enabled
    him to overhear snippets of unguarded conversation, making good use of his
    knowledge of languages other than Dutch, and observe subtleties of
    behaviour. He noticed who bribed his colleagues in order to be seated
    nearer to whom, or further away from whom. This was why he was here, to
    gather information that would no doubt be of use to him in his usual, more
    lucrative, occupation. To this end he used his keen awareness of what was
    going on around him to avoid being co-opted to help with managing the
    press of carriages clogging the drive or carrying in the food which was
    being delivered to the back door.</para>

    <para>As the last guests took their seats in good time for the arrival of
    the bride and her wedding party, the man insinuated himself into a
    position where he would naturally be attending to the most important
    guests who were placed near to the top table. At 17.00 hours exactly,
    Paulina Maria Bisdom van Vliet swept into the room and took her place on
    the 'throne' in the centre of the top table. The familiar figures of her
    father and uncle, brother-in-law Viruly and Gilles le Fevre de Montigny,
    all accompanied by their wives, followed her along with her soon-to-be
    husband, about whom the man knew more than he had ever told. The women of
    the party seated themselves amid much arranging of skirts whilst the men
    had only to worry about their coat tails. The bride was joined on the
    'throne' by Johan Jacob le Fevre de Montigny seated to her left whilst her
    father was on her right flank. Once the top table had settled themselves
    and an expectant hush had descended upon the assembled body the Master of
    Ceremonies stepped forward and set the nuptial celebrations in motion with
    the traditional welcome:</para>

    <para><emphasis>Blijde feestdag, blijde feestdag, blijde
    feestdag</emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis>Wij juighen u tegen</emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis>Gij bragt aan de burger een zeer grote
    zegen</emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis>De velden doorklonk het uit iederen mond</emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis>Blijde feestdag, blijde feestdag</emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis>Ter eere van Bruid en Bruidegom</emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis>Een hartelijk welkom</emphasis></para>

    <para/>

    <para>Happy holiday, happy holiday, happy holiday</para>

    <para>We cheer you</para>

    <para>You brought to the citizen a very large blessing</para>

    <para>It rings through the fields from every mouth</para>

    <para>Happy holiday, happy holiday</para>

    <para>For the honour of bride and groom</para>

    <para>A warm welcome</para>

    <para/>

    <para>A huge cheer rang out from the guests who clapped the couple with
    enthusiasm, although many of them had never before set eyes on either of
    them. The man thought that they were really celebrating the signal to
    begin eating and drinking as much as they liked at someone else's expense,
    as well as capitalising on the opportunity to further their political,
    business and amorous interests. He himself was not particularly interested
    in the food on offer, although one of the other stewards had gossiped that
    he had counted forty-seven different savoury dishes, gleefully listing
    pike, perch, chicken, suckling pig, snipe, hare, partridge, pigeon, lamb
    stuffed with cauliflower, <emphasis>petit pois</emphasis>, beans and
    endives before either his memory or his imagination ran out. This was to
    be followed by seventeen deserts, apparently, but the man had lost
    patience with the fellow's account of these after the fourth type of tart
    had been described. What he was here for was what he would observe and
    overhear as he cleared away the empty plates and glasses.</para>

    <para>As if all the food and drink were not enough to keep the diners
    occupied, the meal was frequently punctuated by speeches from friends and
    family who told the life story of the bride and the groom, or a version of
    it, as well as offering anecdotes which illustrated the admirable
    qualities of each. On a livelier note, the company were invited to join in
    several songs of a whimsical nature relating to magic mops and such like.
    One alleged that the Zweeuwse farmers were amazed at the agility and
    genius of the bride and groom, which the man thought could be taken in
    several ways. These interludes resulted in the majority of the guests
    returning to their seats providing a respite from the general milling
    about which made the man's job more complicated.</para>

    <para>As well as for the usual calls of nature, guests who were not making
    speeches also got up to deliver presents to the bride and groom which she
    unwrapped there and then before handing them over to her intended so that
    they could both admire them before passing them around for the approval of
    everyone else. As was her nature, she kept a meticulous list of who had
    given them what so that the right gift might be brought out on show during
    future visits of the giver. All of this rigmarole took an inordinate
    amount of time and entailed a lot of wandering about, which made it
    difficult for the man to keep track of those people he had identified as
    of special interest to him. But, he also picked up some unexpected pieces
    of intelligence from others as they crossed his path.</para>

    <para>The light had already faded from the summer sky by the time the
    gathering partook of the last few items on the carefully orchestrated
    programme. Three large silver bowls full of brandy and raisins, one for
    each table, began their progress from person to person whilst the assembly
    energetically sang the song;</para>

    <para><emphasis>Hoe zoet is het daar de vriendschap
    woont</emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis/></para>

    <para>How sweet it is where friendship dwells</para>

    <para/>

    <para>Some of the stewards took up baskets laden with small gifts of the
    sweets and wine which they offered to each guest. The <emphasis>Bruid
    suikas</emphasis>, little packages of five sweets wrapped in tulle,
    symbolized the wedding wishes of love, happiness, loyalty, prosperity, and
    virility causing several of the recipients to make wry comments upon the
    latter. The <emphasis>Bruidstranen</emphasis>, small bottles of spiced
    wine containing a little gold leaf to represent the bride's tears, further
    provoked innuendos. The Master of Ceremonies made his closing
    declarations, thanked the assembled party for the Paulina and Johan's
    nuptial celebrations then bade everyone farewell on behalf of the bride
    and groom. The bride and groom rose from their throne to lead the platform
    party out of the <emphasis>grote zaal</emphasis> to a final round of
    cheers and applause.</para>

    <para>In the body of the hall chairs scraped back, clothing rustled and
    the hubbub of conversation resumed as people headed for the doors and
    their waiting transport beyond. This was the last chance for the man to
    pick up morsels of information for the already brimming storehouse in his
    brain before he and the other stewards had to set about the task of
    clearing away and setting the room straight. There was a lull as the men
    changed pace again from the public performance of stewarding to the more
    relaxed nature of backstage domestics. Taking advantage of this social
    space, the man quickly and quietly made his way round the tables pocketing
    those lost, forgotten or abandoned personal items that might later be of
    use to him in his work.</para>

    <para>Once the clatter of work resumed, the man joined in the camaraderie
    which so often spontaneously develops between those who serve as they wind
    down from of important events like this. They, too had heard things and
    were as keen to gossip to their fellows as he was to listen and encourage.
    Even the overseer was in better spirits now that the day had passed off
    successfully, no doubt helped by his having surreptitiously rewarded
    himself with the dregs of the bottles as they were taken out for
    collection. On the orders of the bride, any left-over food had been taken
    for distribution to the poor but she had forbidden them any alcohol and
    the overseer believed that it would have been a shame to waste it. The men
    were instructed to take off their white aprons and shirts so that the
    laundry baskets, into which the table cloths and napkins had already been
    thrown, could be taken away for laundering overnight. They were to hang up
    the rest of their uniforms and change back into their own working clothes
    for the last cleaning up before they straggled out into the night to make
    their weary way home.</para>

    <para>The man was careful to avoid company as he made his way along
    Kruisstraat in the direction of the his hotel which he had carefully
    chosen to afford anonymity by being the largest in Utrecht. As he walked
    along he adjusted his clothing to give a smarter appearance, altering his
    bearing and gait to such good effect that a gentleman returning from a
    late night stroll collected his room key and messages from the night
    porter. He ordered a good supper to be brought to his room, being now very
    hungry as well as wishing to sustain himself for the work of the day yet
    to be done. A ewer of hot water was waiting for him by the time he opened
    his door so he was able to wash and change into his nightshirt and
    dressing gown whilst waiting for his supper tray. The servant bringing his
    food stayed briefly to hang up his clothes and remove the empty water jug
    before being assured that he would not be wanted again that night.</para>

    <para>Having made himself comfortable and secured the privacy of his
    chamber, the man set about organising the material he had gathered at the
    banquet. First he retrieved from his mental filing system all that he
    already knew about the persons of interest whom he had encountered that
    day. Then he put pen to paper making additional notes about each one as
    well as adding some new individuals to his bank of knowledge. One by one
    he dealt with the people he was watching, committing the contents of each
    sheet of notes to his phenomenal memory store. Once all had been attended
    to, the man bent over the grate and dismantled the fire which had been
    laid there against a sudden drop in temperature or bout of illness. He
    carefully twisted and knotted his now discarded papers into bows and
    placed them amongst those which had already formed the basis of the unlit
    fire. He replaced the sticks of kindling and the coals, from small to
    large. Taking a taper from the jar on the grate he lit it from one of the
    lamps and applied it to the foundations of the fire, pleased to see the
    flames immediately take hold creating a sudden and intense conflagration
    which destroyed all it could find to feed on.</para>

    <para>Only now could the man allow himself the luxury of a glass of brandy
    and a cigar sitting in a chair beside the roaring fire. It did not take
    long for him to relax into a state where he was able to get into bed,
    falling asleep to the first bird calls of a new day. It was only a few
    hours until he was woken by the arrival of his morning shaving water but
    he felt refreshed and alert, ready for another working day. Although his
    duties at Tivoli would begin later today, no furniture needing to be moved
    until the second day of banqueting was over, the man began his
    observations at breakfast in the hotel. Here he could keep his eyes on the
    numerous other guests, some due to depart after the previous day's
    celebrations and some preparing for those to come that day, all of whom
    seemed to share the feeling that they could not refuse their invitation as
    it was hard to plead prior engagements for both days. Only Hendrick Prins
    der Nederlanden en Prins van Oranje-Nassau could decline to attend without
    any embarrassment to anyone. Henrik <emphasis>de Zeevaarder</emphasis>, as
    he was known, was a naval man and a navigator like the groom with whom he
    frequently socialised in the manner of sailors on shore leave. The man had
    been very careful not to disclose what he knew of the activities of these
    men when making his report to Theodorus Viruly concerning the groom's
    suitability as a husband for the Bisdom van Vleit daughter.</para>

    <para>Having lingered over breakfast, the man made a thorough check to
    make sure that all was in order in his room then paid his bill and left
    instructions for his luggage to be packed and conveyed to the station left
    luggage office. It was time to set out for his second day at the Tivoli,
    reversing the transformation from gentleman to working man of the previous
    night as he strode along. Although the programme was exactly the same as
    that of the previous day down to the last detail the different mix of
    guests made for a quite distinct experience. The man followed the same
    strategy as previously but found his task was complicated by the
    disruptive boisterousness of the groom's naval shipmates and the presence
    of several important political figures who had seen him before but in a
    different guise. To his relief and satisfaction, he did not appear to have
    been recognised but nevertheless took pains to keep at a distance from
    those who might be able to identify him. On the other hand, the to-ing and
    fro-ing of the seafarers, who refused to stay in their alloted seats and
    demanded a great deal of attention from the stewards, added to the already
    raised levels of activity with the effect that they somewhat hampered the
    man's ability find an unobtrusive place from which to watch and
    listen.</para>

    <para>By the time the guests had left and the clearing up began patience
    was getting stretched among the servants making everyone irritable.
    Tonight they had the added labour of clearing the furniture from the
    <emphasis>grote</emphasis><emphasis> zaal</emphasis>, heavy work for the
    tired men whose minds were already elsewhere with wives and sweethearts,
    food and drink. At last the overseer was satisfied that the room was being
    left as it had been found and called the staff to line up to receive their
    payment before dismissing them to go their separate ways into the night.
    The man had a few hours to kill before catching the early train to Den
    Haag so took a circuitous route to the station, ruefully turning over the
    few coins in his pocket that had been his payment at the end of the two
    days. By the time he had bought himself an early breakfast at the bargee's
    favourite eetcafe on the Oude Gracht and tipped the station porter who
    dealt with his luggage there was not much left. His work was not yet done,
    either, as he still had his records to get up to date once he arrived back
    at his own, solitary dwelling.</para>

    <para>If Paulina had harboured any concerns about being left at the alter
    they were soon dispelled. The whole village could hear the groom's
    procession as it came along the dyke top from Gouda since it was headed up
    by the band of the field artillery regiment playing for all they were
    worth. The groom's carriage was escorted by a huge troop, later reported
    in the Schoonhovensche en Haastrechtsche Courant to have numbered 90, of
    young men dressed in uniforms to match that of the groom. All of his
    guests followed in a long train of horse-drawn conveyances which added to
    their clatter and chatter to the din. As the whole noisy entourage arrived
    at the edge of the village another guard of honour joined them and
    escorted the groom, now on foot, in a swaggering and jubilant procession
    to the Bisdom van Vliet house.</para>

    <para>The Haastrecht villagers had not been unsparing in their
    preparations for Paulina's marriage either. The front door of the house
    had been painted green, as was the tradition, and a triumphal arch erected
    in front of it for the bride to pass under. The children from the village
    school had greatly enjoyed decorating this arch and joining in with the
    making of green flags which were then strung between all the houses in
    Haastrecht and along the fronts of the farms in Stein and Vlist. Flowers,
    and various insignia completed the festoons and even the competing
    religious denominations had come together to raise money in order to make
    a display of their various arms and symbols.</para>

    <para>The correspondent for the Schoonhovensche en Haastrechtsche Courant
    was so overwhelmed by all these wedding preparations that he was reduced
    to somewhat heatedly reporting;</para>

    <para>... <emphasis>het strekke alleen ten bewijze dat daar, waar
    eensgezindheid en erkentijkheid op de voorgrond staan, welwillendheid en
    liefde niet achterblijven.</emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis/></para>

    <para>... this demonstrates that, where harmony and gratitude are to the
    fore, benevolence and love are not far behind.</para>

    <para/>

    <para>The groom's cavalcade halted when it came to the Bisdom van Vliet
    house and here they re-arranged themselves for the next stage in their
    progress. The chamber in the Raadhuis where the formal marriage ceremony
    was to take place was too small to accommodate more than a modest wedding
    party restricted to the couple's most intimate family and friends. All the
    other guests would be provided with light refreshments at the house before
    moving on to the church. Those members of the groom's band, escort and
    honour guard who were not required for the next stage of the procession
    were allowed to relax in the<emphasis> overtuin</emphasis> where they were
    given some rather more modest food and drink than that on offer indoors.
    It took a while for the clamour of the groom's arrival to die down during
    which time Paulina waited patiently in her room until the moment arrived
    when she could be sure of being the centre of attention as she processed
    through the village to begin her nuptials. Those who were to accompany her
    to the Raadhuis gathered in the vestibule, the groom's excess of high
    spirits gradually being calmed by his brother.</para>

    <para>Once the Raadhuis cortege, with a somewhat reduced number of
    musicians and guard of honour, had formed up Marcellus went to fetch his
    daughter. They were both rather disconcerted by Johan Jacob's grandiose
    and flamboyant arrival which threatened to upstage their preparations and
    to eclipse the augustness of the marriage rite itself. Marcellus was aware
    that Viruly still had doubts about the suitability of the bridegroom and
    for the first time he began to have misgivings himself. Paulina sensed a
    reserve in her father's behaviour which made for an awkwardness between
    them quite uncharacteristic of their relationship. She had felt a little
    on edge already but attributed this to the gravity of the occasion. On top
    of this, the delay caused by Johan Jacob's unanticipated departure from
    her carefully arranged schedule had perturbed her. So, she attributed the
    strangeness between herself and her father to bridal nerves which caused
    her to anxiously avert her gaze from him thereby effectively blocking any
    further communication between them. The distance between them meant that
    Marcellus felt unable to gently remind his only child that it was not too
    late to call the wedding off, so he followed her down to the vestibule in
    silence instead.</para>

    <para>Once they reached the crowded vestibule both father and daughter
    found themselves caught up by the expectations of the assemblage which
    involuntarily propelled them into the day their, minds empty of all doubt
    or apprehension. They did, however, depart from protocol in just one way
    when, as a result of some tacit agreement between them, Paulina took her
    father's arm and not that of her bridegroom before stepping out through
    the green door, walking under the triumphal arch and out onto the
    petal-strewn street to take her place at the head of the wedding
    procession. The groom had been so caught up in putting on his own show for
    his admirers that he let the moment pass when he might have intervened and
    claimed his bride for his own arm. It took some management by his brother
    to focus his attention and prevail upon him to fall in behind his bride
    and her father ahead of the other members of their families and the chosen
    friends.</para>

    <para>The Hoogstrat was lined with cheering adults and children who had
    come out in their numbers to scatter petals under the bride's feet and
    wish the her well. Paulina and Marcellus walked slowly so as to
    acknowledge the crowd's good wishes and show their appreciation and
    admiration for the bedecked streets. At last they arrived at the bottom of
    the stone steps leading up to the marriage room within the Raadhuis. The
    pretty little step-gabled town hall was so old that it even pre-dated the
    arrival of Adriaan Bisdom in Haastrecht. At one point its steps decayed to
    become so unsafe that old Oma's husband, burgemeester Salomon Reynders
    Bisdom van Vliet, had ordered them demolished and replaced by the handsome
    hard stone steps which now rose to the door into De Burgerzaal where all
    the marriages were solemnized including those of Paulina's ancestors. It
    was only when they reached the bottom of the steps that Paulina's father
    looked round for Johan Jacob, signaling that the groom should now step up
    beside the bride to accept the greetings and thanks of the guests as they
    made their way into the wedding room.</para>

    <para>When everyone in the intimate circle had disappeared into the
    Raadhuis, Paulina made her way up the seven steps supporting herself by
    holding onto the iron hand rail with one had and her groom with the other.
    Perhaps it was that his feet were obscured by her huge skirts but Paulina
    did not feel that Johan Jacob was entirely confident on his feet and was
    glad when they reached the level platform between the steps and the
    doorway. A lion statue stood at either end of this balcony, one holding
    the coat of arms of Haastrecht and the other holding the arms of South
    Holland. Since she had been a child visiting her father in his
    burgermeesterskamer Paulina had been in the habit of touching the top of
    each lion's head for good luck and she did not intend to tempt fate by
    breaking this pattern today. As she reached for the first lion she
    inadvertently jostled Johan Jacob causing him to totter back down the top
    step, confirming her feeling that he had not quite lost his sea legs. Once
    the second lion had had his head tapped Paulina made her grand entry into
    the Raadhuis with the now recovered Johan Jacob in her wake.</para>

    <para>Marcellus's deputy was to perform the ceremony and was there inside
    the door to greet the bride and groom, ushering them to their places
    before the table which held the large book in which their marriage was to
    be recorded. As Johan Jacob removed his ceremonial sword and handed it to
    his brother before being seated, Paulina took her first proper look at her
    bridegroom. He was resplendent in a uniform decorated with shiny buttons,
    badges and shoulder boards as well as the belt which had held his sword
    and scabbard. Her heart leapt at the sight of him, restoring to the full
    her confidence in the marriage she was about to contract. But first they
    had to wait for the company to settle down. The room was full to capacity
    as the importance of the Bisdom van Vliet's dictated that the maximum
    possible number of guests be accommodated. The generous proportions of the
    floral arrangements placed on the floor at the end of each row of seats
    combined with the copious skirts of the ladies to fill every available
    niche so that it seemed as though the smiling faces of the guests were
    floating above a billowing sea of shimmering fabrics and colourful blooms.
    It was also quite dim and hot in the chamber as the door and lower window
    shutters had been closed for privacy allowing little light or air to wash
    over what remained of the unoccupied space in the room.</para>

    <para>Paulina was, therefore, glad that the formalities were quickly under
    way and conducted at a brisk pace. After a brief speech of welcome, the
    Loco-burgemeester asked the couple to stand and face each other, clasping
    their right hands. First his marriage vow was read to Johan Jacob to which
    he assented in a clear, firm voice. Then Paulina Maria heard her vows and
    also gave her assent without hesitation. A murmur of delight ran round the
    room. In his role as Ambtenaar van de Burgerlijke Stand, Marcellus's
    deputy managed to balance due gravitas with a lightness of touch that left
    the gathering in a suitably celebratory mood when he seized the right
    moment to pronounce Paulina and Jacob wedded in the eyes of the law. Johan
    kissed his bride to a round of applause from the gathering before the
    couple took their seats again for the final formality of signing the
    register.</para>

    <para>Man and wife now led the way back through the cheering villagers
    lining Hoogstraat, taking the turning down to the church instead of
    continuing to the house.. They passed beneath another triumphal arch and
    were scattered with more petals as they stood to one side and accepted the
    congratulations of the last members of the congregation as they filed past
    them into the church. Once everyone was seated inside, the Pastor led the
    couple to their seats beside him at the front of the knave. The interior
    of the plain white church was decorated with floral displays of an even
    more striking size and vibrancy than those in the Raadhuis and swags of
    pure white tulle decorated the ends of all the pews.</para>

    <para>Paulina was thankful that there was more space, light and air inside
    the church as she knew that the consecration of her marriage before God
    was going to be a more lengthy affair than the civil ceremony had been.
    She was glad of the presence of her parents seated nearby in the front row
    of pews, surprising herself at how much she drew support just from seeing
    them there. She was feeling more emotional than she would ever have
    thought she could be and, although she considered herself to be a devout
    woman who was a regular worshiper at the church, Paulina found the length
    of the wedding service tested her capacity for stoicism almost to its
    limit. With great self-discipline she sat through many readings from the
    Bible, a lengthy homily from the Pastor and more speeches by close family
    and friends. It was something of a relief when this seemingly endless
    stream of well-intentioned words was punctuated by music and, better yet,
    standing to sing a hymn.</para>

    <para>Then Paulina and Johan were stirred to action as they were called to
    stand before the Pastor and take turns in repeating their vows before God,
    now more fully and explicitly stating the duties and responsibilities of
    marriage which they were accepting. A gold ring resting on a plush velvet
    cushion was brought before the Pastor who blessed it and reminded the
    couple that it was a symbol of the eternity of the marriage bond which was
    to be placed on the right hand as this was the good, not sinister, hand
    and so connected to the divine. Johan picked up the ring then gently took
    Paulina's right hand in his left and slipped the ring onto her third
    finger. She felt a lump rise in her throat and tears well up in her eyes,
    indeed she trembled with a suppressed sob. In response to this Johan gave
    her hand a gentle squeeze and, when she turned to look at him, she found
    that he, too, had moist eyes.</para>

    <para>Another red velvet cushion was brought to the Pastor, this one
    supporting the wedding bible in the front of which their marriage was
    already inscribed and where they would go on to add the names and dates of
    birth of their children along with other significant events, not all of
    which would be so joyous. The bible was given into Johan's keeping with
    the direction that the couple should keep it as the family bible for the
    new le Fevre de Montingy - Bisdom van Vliet line. Paulina felt a flush of
    pride when she heard her family name so openly and directly linked with
    that of her husband as founders of a new branch of the family. It mattered
    very much to her that she should produce an heir to the wealth and
    position of her family. But there was a deeper need arriving within her
    that suddenly demanded her attention - she wanted to have children, soon
    and lots of them. She was abashed at this very public allusion to such
    intimate matters, not fully realising that her private thoughts remained
    hidden from scrutiny and not as conspicuous to the congregation looking on
    as she feared. Rather self-consciously, she risked a sidelong glance at
    Johan and found him looking intently at the bible in his hands with a
    sheepish expression on his face which somewhat puzzled her.</para>

    <para>Then suddenly it was over and Paulina felt thoroughly and very
    publicly married. As she and Johan turned to face the body of the church
    in preparation for making their exit, Paulina half hoped that he would be
    romantic enough to kiss her again in front of everybody whilst admitting
    to herself that this would actually embarrass her. She did not quite know
    if she was glad or not that no kiss was forthcoming, instead he took her
    hand and placed it through his arm for the procession out of the church
    where, reunited with his sword, he would escort her back to the family's
    house. Once more they made their way haltingly as they accepted the
    congratulations of the onlookers, smiling until their faces felt as if
    they might never go back straight again. When they had attained the
    sanctuary of the house they were tactfully granted some time to themselves
    in a small ante-room on the ground floor the old
    <emphasis>familiehuis</emphasis>. Now they held each other and exchanged
    kisses with the freedom that being married now allowed them as well as the
    awkwardness of novelty.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>The rest of her wedding day did not pass off with quite the finesse
    that Paulina could have wished for. It had sounded eminently sensible when
    Johan had explained to her that, by the time they might reasonable expect
    to be able to take their leave from Haastrecht, it would be too late in
    the day for an immediate departure for Germany and the start of their
    honeymoon trip, yet she could not hide from herself that she was a little
    disappointed. This sense of blighted hopes deepened into disgruntlement
    when he told her that they would be spending their first night of marriage
    in his rooms at the Hotel De Zalm. Perhaps familiarity should not breed
    contempt but nevertheless she felt somewhat irked that commonplace old
    Gouda and Johan's habitual residence were to be the setting for the
    consummation that would mark the final covenant of their marriage. If the
    arrangements had been left to her then a more exclusive and original venue
    would have been found, one which held no resonances with their separate
    pasts. On the other hand, Gouda did have the cachet of being the place
    where they met.</para>

    <para>To convey them to the hotel Johan had ordered an appropriately
    luxurious landau which was pulled by a pair of fine white horses and
    decorated with flowers and ribbons. When the time came for them to set out
    for their new life together their closest family gathered in the
    <emphasis>familiehuis</emphasis> vestibule for the final farewells.
    Paulina found it hard to tear herself away from her papa's embrace but saw
    that her mama was waiting for her turn to tearfully hug and kiss her
    youngest daughter as she left the shelter of her family to embark on the
    joys and sorrows of the wedded state. After discreetly allowing the Bisdom
    van Vliets a few moments of farewell Johan stepped forward to claim his
    bride, leaving her mother and father to cling to each other in their
    happiness and grief.</para>

    <para>A liveried coachman assisted the couple into the landau to take the
    seats which faced forwards whilst a boy groom held the horses. When they
    were settled and ready to depart, the lad took his seat behind them whilst
    the coachman climbed up onto his box, taking the four reins in hand ready
    for the signal to set off. The top of the carriage was folded down which,
    along with its low shell, insured that anyone looking on would have a good
    view of the couple in all their finery. In readiness for going away
    Paulina had changed into a quite plain but full cut skirt made of a richly
    patterned ivory silk on top of which she wore a jacket of a deep red satin
    silk which was ruffled around the edges as well as the top and bottom of
    the narrow cut sleeves. This was her new carriage costume which had been
    specially made for use on her honeymoon, her bride dress being now a
    discarded thing left behind whilst the rest of her trousseau already sent
    on ahead to await her arrival in Gouda. An ivory lace scarf tied at the
    high neck of an ivory under blouse completed the outfit and gave it a
    slightly jaunty look. Bare-headed as usual, her only adornment was the
    earrings which had been a gift from Johan during their brief courtship
    and, of course, her golden wedding ring.</para>

    <para>The rump of Johan's musicians and guard of honour led the way out of
    the village and along the dyke top, but they had lost some of their
    enthusiasm and, for Paulina, all of their rather limited charm so she was
    thoroughly relieved when they called a halt at Stolwijkersluis so that she
    and Johan could continue the last leg of its journey alone and in peace.
    Their escort had served one valuable purpose which was distract from a
    sudden reticence that caused a lull in the conversation between herself
    and Johan. He seemed rather preoccupied with preening his uniform and
    smoothing his hair, having apparently paid scant attention to her or made
    any comment on her change of costume. Paulina was left to gaze rather
    sullenly at the familiar passing landscape and try not to feel . Upon
    their arrival at De Zalm she was disconcerted to find all his friends and
    fellow hotel guests assembled outside to greet him and, rather secondarily
    it seemed, his wife. She forced her aching face to smile and her
    complaining stomach to accept a glass of Champagne and some savouries from
    the trays which circulated in quick succession. Johan was reinvigorated by
    the attention of his cronies, not to mention the ingestion of several
    glasses of Champagne, whilst she was wilting and starting to doubt her
    ability to stay on her feet for much longer.</para>

    <para>Not at all accustomed to the sensation of physical weakness, Paulina
    did not know what to do except try to lean on Johan for support but he had
    disappeared into the bustle of people and was lost to her. Suddenly a maid
    appeared at her side and suggested that she might like to follow her
    inside the hotel to find somewhere quiet to catch her breath. This pretty
    little creature seemed to know exactly what was needed and how to arrange
    things without making Paulina feel in the least bit inferior or
    vulnerable. Paulina followed the maid to a small drawing room where she
    was alone and allowed herself to be helped to take a seat in the
    protective embrace of a comfortable wing chair. A glass of seltzer water
    was fetched and the maid unobtrusively shut the curtains on the sunny side
    of the room before asking if there was anything else madam required.
    Paulina could think of nothing, nothing at all, so thanked the young woman
    and dismissed her with a slight waft of her right hand.</para>

    <para>As soon as the maid was gone Paulina started to feel a bleakness of
    spirit which only grew worse as she brooded on the thought that Johan had
    abandoned her, seemingly heedless of his obligations, on their special
    day. She was glad to have the space to recover herself from the hurley
    burley outside and yet the notion that Johan had not noticed her absence
    and come looking for her promoted a sudden wavering in her belief in his
    love and his commitment to their marriage. She started to sink into a
    perilous quagmire of hurt and insecurity, a novel sensation which she did
    not like at all. As she reached the brink of despair and peered into the
    black abyss beyond, the apparatus at the core of her character stirred
    into action and drove a rallying of her strength that energised her will
    to deal with the situation. She must behave as the independent woman she
    knew herself to be deep down and not the sort of silly person whose role
    she had rejected not so many weeks ago and in the very church now just
    across the Maarkt. On that June day she had determined to have her own
    life and not be governed by conventions of marriage or the demands of a
    husband.</para>

    <para>She had anticipated a period of quiet settling into their rooms
    would follow arrival at De Zalm so this was just what she would arrange
    for herself. Paulina rose from her chair and rang for a servant. When the
    little maid appeared she gave instructions that she wished to be shown to
    their rooms where she desired to have tea and cakes brought to her. A
    flash of spite held her back from asking for Johan to be informed of her
    whereabouts, however. The maid went to fetch a porter with the key and
    Paulina followed him up the stairs to the second floor where she was let
    into a drawing room at the front of the building. She held out her hand
    for the key which the porter hesitantly yielded up in exchange for a small
    gratuity, quickly pocketed, before departing to organise her tea tray to
    be sent up. Going over to one of the rooms two tall windows she held back
    the edge of the net curtain and took in the view of the Stadhuis and,
    across the Maarkt, Sint Janskerk. Despite her taut nerves she could not
    help but appreciate the outlook and draw comfort and strength from seeing
    the tower of the great church rising above the city. </para>

    <para>After some minutes contemplation of the view from the window, she
    turned to take in the rest of the room which she saw to be equipped with
    good quality, fashionable furniture of a style in keeping with that of the
    building itself. Through her visits to Aggie and Theo she was keenly aware
    of the controversy which had surrounded the granting of permission for the
    original De Zalm, claimed by some to be the oldest inn in the Netherlands,
    to be completely remodelled in the style fashionable in Den Haag. The new
    building towered over the old Waag, something that could never have been
    countenanced in earlier centuries, and its bright, white exterior
    dominated the market square and upset many local traditionalists. Theo had
    been keen to push for progress and she now found that she rather approved
    of what had been achieved, considering that the old place had been rather
    dilapidated and vulgar whereas the room she was standing in was light,
    tasteful and very respectable.</para>

    <para>Aside from the main door leading out onto the landing, there was a
    second door in the room which could only lead to the more private
    quarters. It stood ever so slightly ajar tempting her to push it further
    open whereas she would have hesitated to open a closed door. It was a
    heavy door and a tentative nudge only moved it a little but that was
    enough to reveal a dresser on which stood an open gentleman's travelling
    dressing table case, a selection of its contents having been taken out for
    use and left lying on the dresser top beside it. Paulina was rooted to the
    spot as she looked at these personal items belonging to Johan and which
    now possessed the cachet of marital intimacy. Until now Paulina had not
    even considered what married life might mean in the way of such personal
    details, having been completely caught up with the event of the wedding
    itself. The silver shaving brush and holder, the shaving stick in its
    holder, an ivory-backed clothes brush, an ivory-backed hair brush, various
    plain glass bottles with silver stoppers and an open red leather manicure
    set spoke to Johan's private preparations for the day. Of course she found
    Johan handsome and, despite his apparent carelessness towards her, still
    she longed to be in his arms again and quite understood what was to happen
    to consummate their union. But now, peeping round the door at these
    masculine items and imagining him applying them to his physical person, it
    struck her full force that Johan was corporeal and his male body was now
    part of her life. The idea confounded her as desire fought with distaste,
    rooting her to the spot.</para>

    <para>Just at that moment the main door to the room opened to the rattling
    of things on the tea tray. Paulina quickly turned back into the drawing
    room feeling as if she had been caught out like a naughty child. She
    expected to see a servant and was even more disconcerted to come face to
    face with Johan instead. Unbeknownst to Paulina, the little maid had taken
    the liberty, presuming upon their earlier dealings, to approach Johan and
    discretely inform him of Paulina's situation and the necessity for him to
    go to her. Realizing his oversight Johan had immediately gone to their
    rooms, just happening to arrive at the door just as the waiter with the
    tea tray was about to knock. He had hurried in ahead of the man, concerned
    to compensate for his laxity as a husband with solicitousness towards the
    wife he was not yet accustomed to having.</para>

    <para>"My dear, I missed you at the party downstairs and grew concerned.
    Tell me truly, are you feeling unwell?"</para>

    <para>Conscious that the servant might overhear them in their imperfection
    as a couple, Paulina waited until the door had closed behind him before
    replying;</para>

    <para>"I am quite well, thank you. Just a little fatigued but I shall soon
    be recovered."</para>

    <para>"I am so relieved to hear you say so. I was distressed to think that
    you had been taken ill and I was unaware of it. But, here you are and
    looking quite the picture of health!"</para>

    <para>She had tried to be cool towards him but now that Johan was back
    with her she found that she just wanted his arms about her and this had
    brought colour into her face. Seizing his advantage, Johan took her in an
    embrace whilst saying; </para>

    <para>"I took the liberty of asking for an extra cup and plate to be
    fetched so that we might take tea together and enjoy being alone. It has
    been a marvelous celebration of our marriage and I have revelled in every
    part of it but I am also looking forward to your private
    companionship."</para>

    <para>He broke off to kiss her neck and stroke her unruly hair before
    continuing;</para>

    <para>"Let us keep to ourselves for the rest of today. What do you say?
    Just an old married couple spending a quiet night together? "</para>

    <para>Before she could reply there was a knock at the door, which caused
    her to start and break away from Johan, and the waiter came in with the
    extra crockery and cutlery. Once they were alone again, she felt herself
    enveloped by Johan as he pressed her close and began gently kissing her
    neck then her cheek and finally her mouth. His affection had a calming,
    almost soporific, effect on her and she found the closeness of his body
    brought her a sense of comfort. Indeed, the feeling she had was
    reminiscent of the times when, as a child, she had been soothed and sent
    to sleep by snuggling up to her nanny. But Johan was a man with a man's
    urges, yet an experienced lover who knew to slacken his embrace before the
    urgency of his erection could be felt even through Paulina's thick
    petticoats. He knew that he must take care not to cause her any
    consternation as that would only make her more resistant to him when the
    time came. </para>

    <para>The distraction of taking tea was just what was required to soothe
    them both in their different ways and to reconcile them to the finality of
    their marital pledge. The social routine of an apparently normal evening
    provided just enough interest and activity to distract from the tacit
    prospect of their impending first sexual encounter. As there was only one
    suite of bedroom and dressing rooms and it would have been unthinkable as
    yet for both to occupy them simultaneously whilst changing for dinner, so
    Johan deferred to Paulina who summoned her maid and the two women
    disappeared into the private apartments. Paulina now saw what lay behind
    the door which she had earlier peeped round, finding that her maid had
    already unpacked her necessary things and laid out her new dinner dress on
    the bed. Paulina, with the help of her maid, took great care over her
    toilette not simply in order to please Johan but also as a way of taking
    the time to calm herself in this rather thrilling but slightly alarming
    new situation through the slow performance of familiar routines.</para>

    <para>At last she emerged and accepted Johan's admiration of her
    appearance. He had not been idle during her absence having provided a
    selection of newspapers and magazines for her to peruse. He had also
    ordered Champagne and, in case she might prefer it, Paulina's favourite
    red vermouth and some seltzer water all of which were ready for her to
    make her selection of beverage. Johan settled her in a chair with all that
    she said she required readily to hand before bending to kiss her once more
    prior to taking his leave to get changed. In his absence she sipped some
    seltzer water and looked through the newspapers for anything about
    Haastrecht or anyone of her acquaintance but, since there was very little
    to arouse her interest, she began a desultory examination of the
    magazines. </para>

    <para>She was on the point of having to admit to herself that she was
    simply waiting for Johan to return when the bedroom door opened and he
    rejoined her, looking very smart in his dinner clothes and smelling of a
    pleasingly light and fresh cologne. Johan uncorked the Champagne but she
    declined his offer of a glass and he did not entreat her. He did, however,
    help himself before drawing his chair close to hers and taking his seat.
    They both confessed to being glad to be rid of their bulky and hot outdoor
    clothes. It had been an unusually hot day for late summer, which Paulina
    felt had blessed their wedding day although she could see that Johan would
    have been more affected by the heat in his thick uniform clothes than she
    was in her relatively light gown. Johan amused her with an account of how
    uncooperative he had found his ceremonial sword, leaping to his feet to
    re-enact some of his less adroit moments as he found it necessary to
    remove and re-attach this willful prop at several points during the day.
    Laughing conspiratorially with him made her feel that they were sharing a
    secret which must serve to bring them closer together.</para>

    <para>Johan proposed that they should dine in their rooms, to which she
    readily assented feeling that she had been in the public eye quite enough
    for one day. Having first solicited her approval, Johan then took charge
    of ordering a selection of dishes that he thought to be her favourites and
    which he believed that the De Zalm chef could execute to a high standard.
    She found it pleasing that he showed himself to be aware of her tastes in
    food and honoured that he was so desirous of ensuring that his knowledge
    of the hotel kitchen could be applied to making sure that the best
    available fare was placed before her. She was delighted by the sumptuous
    array of elegantly presented plates that were placed before them and was
    eager to sample them all. Oddly, her appetite somehow deserted her and she
    found that she could only manage the first mouthful of each thing on her
    plate, delicious though everything tasted. She was grateful for Johan's
    consideration in that he did not push her to eat or drink more than she
    chose to although she noticed that he ate heartily himself as well as
    drinking the whole bottle of Champagne.</para>

    <para>Once their repast had lost its appeal and the evidence of it had
    been cleared away by the servants they found themselves alone again.
    Paulina felt a brief flash of awkwardness but Johan soon dispelled any
    strangeness between them with his attentiveness and she quickly found that
    they were chatting away quite comfortably and finding themselves in accord
    on anything and everything. She was charmed by Johan using endearments
    without committing the error of being overly familiar. She also found him
    quite enchanting in the way he added the frisson of a little touch here
    and a kiss there to the rapport developing between them. He knew exactly
    how and when to suggest that they prepare for the night so that it seemed
    the most natural thing in the world that they should find themselves alone
    together in the bedroom after her maid and his man had been dismissed. She
    found that he also knew just how to tantalize them both with glimpses and
    assurances, kisses and caresses so that she willingly joined him in the
    big hotel bed. But once they were between the sheets with the lamps
    extinguished the night did not pass quite as either of them might have
    predicted.</para>

    <para>Maybe Johan had drunk too much Champagne. Perhaps Paulina had become
    overheated by his long, slow seduction. Possibly he had been too
    proficient in his conquest. Certainly both were overwrought after the
    hectic and tiring few weeks leading up to this climax of their nuptials.
    It could be that Paulina had shed her sexual inhibitions along with all
    the other strictures placed upon a woman of her station in life. What was
    certain was that Johan, who had been prepared to coax and cajole his way
    into her in the belief that patrician women were not by nature sexual
    beings, shrank in the face of her frank interest in his genitals. She, in
    turn, was somewhat discomfited that her knowledge of how these matters
    proceeded, which had been largely gained in the stables and farms with
    little ameliorating advice from her mother, did not lead to the
    deflowering she had imagined would follow naturally. She found that Johan
    now started to flounder about whilst her efforts became increasingly
    fraught and useless until she simply gave up then fell into a fitful sleep
    that left her both exhausted and unsatisfied when she woke the next
    morning. Her cherished hope of a honeymoon pregnancy now took on the
    appearance of a fading dream.</para>

  <title>New Year 1871</title>

  <section>
    <title/>
    <para>They had travelled to Haastrecht to join the big family gathering at
    her parents' house, which Paulina still thought of as 'home', for the
    celebration the start of a new year. Aggie and Theo were there with their
    brood of eight children as was Uncle Otto and Adelaide with their six.
    Next to her own family the le Fevre de Montigny's made a sorry
    contribution to the numbers with just one child between them, Gillis and
    Mary's small son now aged three. The total of fourteen children whose ages
    ranged between two and twenty three along with the mix of adults who
    brought with them a variety of ill-concealed tensions made the assemblage
    a somewhat complicated one. The more grown up offspring tried to be part
    of the adult festivities unaware of their undercurrents to the rather
    strained atmosphere so innocently adding their contribution. The six
    little ones became rather rowdy in the excitement of a game of
    hide-and-seek in the favourably rambling old
    <emphasis>familiehuis</emphasis>. The four younsters who were neither
    children nor yet grown up didn't quite know what to do with themselves so
    roamed about feeling awkward, especially since they were divided equally
    between two different family groups so did not know eachother very
    well.</para>

    <para>Paulina had some sympathy with those who seemed out of place among
    the party. It was at times like this that she felt something of an odd one
    out herself having failed to produce a child after sixteen months of
    marriage. She was acutely self-aware that the others were noticing her
    barrenness and negatively judging her marriage or, more precisely, her was
    distressing and only served to intensify the pain of her unfulfilled
    longing for children. She wished that she could tell someone, her mother
    maybe or, better still, Aggie, what her situation was but it was too
    private a matter to be spoken of. Besides, there had been some sort of
    cooling towards her on Aggie's part since she married Johan which she
    suspected had its origins in Theo's unspoken but evident disapproval of
    her choice of husband.</para>

    <para>If she could have spoken out, she would have reassured them that all
    was normal with her monthly cycle and that marital relations were not
    lacking. Indeed, following the rather disappointing first night their
    honeymoon had proved a singular success on all fronts with the exception
    that she had not conceived. They had set out from Gouda to take the train
    down through Germany where they embarked on a Rhine steamer at Koblenz for
    the passage upstream to Mainz through the stunning and romantic scenery of
    the Mittelrhein gorge with its vine-clad slopes and skyline of medieval
    castles . The passage was a slow one but not without charm and periods of
    danger and excitement. Just above Koblenz the steamer encountered a vast
    raft of hundreds of tree trunks being swept downstream towards its
    destination at Andernach where it was to be separated into batches for
    dispersal all across the north of Europe. Even such an experienced sailor
    as Johan was taken aback by this enormous platform of timber so vast that
    the hundreds of men required to navigate it had built a village of huts on
    top of it to shelter them on their long journey north from the upper
    reaches of the great river. The pilot of the steamer had a delicate task
    to perform in order to avoid the timber raft, which had very little
    steering, whilst keeping his ship in the narrow channel cut through the
    sharp rocks of the river bed.</para>

    <para>No sooner was the encounter with the raft safely behind them than
    they had cause to marvel again at the pilot's skill as he threaded the
    steamer between the many barges transporting their cargoes up and down the
    river. Only a small proportion of these commercial vessels were powered by
    steam so those under sail on the downstream run wove and tacked across
    their path, borne down upon the current. Going their way, steam tugs with
    their lengthy tows of barges crept upstream impeding the progress of the
    faster passenger ship, itself battling upstream against the strong
    current. The dogged pounding of the steam engine found its echo in the
    progress of Paulina and Johan's physical relationship as they persevered
    with the consummation of their union. The strain on their relationship at
    last relieved during an overnight stop at Sankt Goar, they were able to
    enjoy being on deck the next day to admire the Lorelei rock around which
    the river was forced into a trecherously sharp bend causing notoriously
    dangerous whirlpools. Soon after this excitement they came upon the
    Pfalzgrafenstein castle moored out in the river like ship of stone whose
    purpose had been to exact tolls from river users until just two years
    previously. They joined in with the spontaneous cheer that went up from
    the passengers as the note fo the ships' engine relaxed once a line from a
    hauling engine on the bank had been attached to pull them up through the
    rapids to their next halt at Bingen.</para>

    <para>They finally quitted the Rhine steamer at Mainz to travel on by
    stagecoach to Metz . This soon brought them into the still disputed border
    between Germany and France following the recent Franco-Prussian War whose
    legacy of refugees and the grim evidence of military action was
    distressing to Paulina creating the need for the comfort of Johan's arms
    at night. Moving into more peaceful territory, they took time to enjoy the
    French coutryside as well as the cities of Nancy, Langres and Dijon before
    arriving at Lyon where they embarked on another river steamer, this time
    going with the current of the river Rhone which carried them south through
    Arles and the Camargue to the Medditterranean. The season was now turning
    from summer to autumn and they were glad to be journeying into warmer
    southern climes where the freezing of the rivers would arrive somewhat
    later than at home.</para>

    <para>Their passage down the Rhone was quite unlike their earlier Rhine
    trip. This time it was the speed of the river that made it thrilling,
    compounded by the ever-preesent risk of running aground as a dry summer
    had reduced water levels. Although the steam vessels on the Rhone could
    make the trip from Lyon to Arles in a day, Johan had arranged for them to
    break their journey at Vienne to see the Roman buildings and at Avignon
    for the Palace that was once the seat of Popes. Johan had booked a cabin
    for the leg of their voyage between these two stops feeling that because
    the evenings were lengthening towards winter they would appreciate having
    somewhere to retire to for the evening.</para>

    <para>After embarking again at Vienne Paulina and Johan went out on deck
    to enjoy the warmth of a sunny autumn afternoon as the ship gathered speed
    towards the looping curves in the river at Les Roches de Condrieu. Caught
    up on the fast flowing current as she took the outside of the tightest
    bend it seemed as though the ship was being swept out of control to only
    avoided coliding with the right bank butress of the bridge by dint of good
    fortune. Paulina clung to Johan as she felt the danger mounting and was
    surprised to find that, beneath his calm exterior, she could sense that
    he, too, was excited and thrilled. No word needed to be spoken as they
    made their hurried towards their cabin and, once inside, made haste to
    assist eachother out of the layers of clothing put on against the chill
    river airs. Buttons, ties and all manner of fastenings were dealt with as
    sleeves, skirts, trousers and linnen undergarments were made to obey the
    force of gravity with embarrassment now giving way to laughter and
    boisterous delight. They tumbled together in a tangle of strange bedding
    within the narrow confines of their box-like bunk until both were
    exhausted and completely sated. They had fallen into a serene doze when
    the steward knocked on the door to inform that dinner was soon to be
    served, causing them to realize that they were parched and
    ravenous.</para>

    <para>They emerged on deck to the sad sight of the scoured vinyards
    following the devastating phylloxera infection which had its origins at
    Roquemaure a little to the north of Avignon which Paulina later took to be
    a portent of her own barrenness. The warmth of the Medditterranen creeps
    up the Rhone valley to temper the climate of Avignon and kept the
    passionate connection she had found with Johan alive. This honeymoon
    spirit lasted all through their time at Arles but, by the time that they
    turned north to climb up into the mountains to Gap, Grenoble, Annecy then
    into Switzerland, she knew that she had not conceived. Hope and longing
    cooled with the mountain air and the arrival of October. The change of
    landscape, archtiecture and a whole way of life mirrored the calming and
    cooling between Paulina and Johan as intensity and heat gave way to less
    sensual and more regulated emotions.</para>

    <para>With Johan at her side she was able to recapture her facsination for
    the flora and fauna of the mountains which had had such a profound effect
    on her during her first visit in 1865. Together they admired the glaciers
    in the Swiss Alps, especially the vast Rhone glacier at Valais and gazed
    out over Lake Geneva from the balcony of their hotel room in Lausanne.
    Feeling the majesty of the towering mountains and fathomless water and
    ice. Then it was time to make the last leg of their journey back to Den
    Haag through the familar territory of Germany and The Netherlands to the
    anti-climax of a house that was serviceable but still required some work
    to bring it up to scratch and the realities of day to day married
    life.</para>

    <para>Now, more than a year on, they had become accustomed to inhabiting a
    house that still wanted for its final polish and to their relationship
    which had settled down to the comfort of the habitual. Yet, there were
    times when they were undeniably at odds with eachother in some way which
    neither of them seemed able to fathom or put right. Whilst Paulina's mind
    could accept that Johan was free to continue his own life just as she was
    still continuing her own occupations and activities just as before their
    marriage, there were times when her head could not rule her sensibilities.
    She had come to associate her periods of discomfort with the glimpses she
    would catch of a strange man who seemed to appear as if out of thin air
    and disappear again just as mysteriously. This man had the effect of
    causing Johan to immediately order his bags packed for travelling,
    pleading business interets that urgently required his presence. He would
    leave without giving any indication of where he was going or how long he
    expected to be away. Sometimes he returned quickly but occasionally he was
    away for some weeks with no word being sent to her and no means of her
    being able to contact him. On his return her never spoke of where he had
    been, who he had seen, what he had done or why he had been gone yet he was
    evidently glad to see her and resumed their intimacy with some
    urgency.</para>

    <para/>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>Paulina found herself prey to feelings of boredom and malaise on
    being left alone in the house during Johan's unpredictable and secretive
    absences. As a seasoned letter writer she longed for a correspondence with
    Johan such as she had enjoyed during their brief courtship, at first
    continuing to write him letters that were destined to languish unsent in
    her bureau drawer. Eventually she gave up this abortive attempt at
    correspondence only to fall prey to a need to find some plank of certainty
    to support her across the void between them. On one particularly grey and
    empty afternoon she found herself loitering outside the door to Johan's
    rooms. Although she knew that she was alone in the house which, in any
    case, she was mistress of, Paulina still had to struggle against the idea
    that trespassing on Johan's private affairs would somehow cojour up
    someone on the other side of the door who would catch her in the
    act.</para>

    <para>Suddenly she was in Johan's drawing room with her back to the door
    she had hastily but quietly closed behind her. listening intently for any
    disturbance to the silence of the empty house. She had been in this room
    often so now her eyes roved around it looking for what was new, what was
    missing or any clues to the riddle of his absences. She was well aware of
    the fact that many married men took mistresses but it was painful to think
    that Johan might be straying so soon after marrying, she believed, for
    love and whilst their own passion was not yet spent. Was he was seeing
    another woman or even, and this was an excrutiating thought, did he have a
    family hidden away somewhere? Of course, she would have to turn a blind
    eye, before which she would need to know what it was she must not
    see.</para>

    <para>The first time Paulina entered Johan's rooms she did not dare to
    make more than a cursory inspection of his personal items, not caring to
    attribute to herself the judgement she would have passed had she caught
    someone else prying into his privacy. However, as her visits became an
    established habit so the voice of the moral other gradually quieted, a
    danger repeated assuming the safety of a commonplace. She began by looking
    inside drawers and cupboards, then would remove and inspect their
    contents. Eventually, she crossed the line between curiosoty and
    investigation so that the more hidden the item the greater the frisson
    gained by removing, inspecting then replacing things exactly as she found
    them. She read every paper she could unearth however trivial until it was
    unclear whether the challenge of spying had suplanted the need for
    certainty in driving her on.</para>

    <para>In any case, what she found made no sense. Sometimes his naval
    things were missing and she felt secure in the belief that he was at sea
    until it occured to her that his life mght be in danger. At other times,
    nothing seemed to have been taken apart from the bare minimum required by
    a gentleman on the move. His papers mostly referred to business dealings
    which her sharp mind for such matters told her were all above board and in
    good order. Such items of personal correspondence as he appeared to have
    kept mostly related to exchanges of letters with his brother, her father
    and, reassuringly, herself. Not a hint of anything that she could latch
    onto for an explanation for where her husband was or what he was
    doing.</para>

    <para>Then, out of the blue, something intruiging to her came along, not
    through her snooping, but in the post. She found a letter addressed to
    Johan mixed up with her own letters on the silver post tray brought to her
    by the maid. Usually Johan's correspondence was sorted from hers and left
    on the hall table where Paulina was in the habit of checking for anything
    unexpected when she was sure she was not being observed. On this occasion
    something out of the ordinary had been literally handed to her on a plate.
    She tried to ignore it and attend to her own business but the tiny
    envelope with a Rotterdam postmark drew her attention away from everything
    else. Had the maid left it on purpose? Would the maid see her mistake and
    try to retrieve the letter? Paulina made sure that she kept the stray item
    out of sight whenever she thought she might be disturbed, sneaking looks
    at the envelope whenever her curiosity had to be answered. It seemed a
    long day until the maids went home and Paulina was alone with what had by
    now grown into a great mystery. But how to discover the contents of the
    envelope without detection?</para>

    <para>Remembering that they had a Gazeteer of Rotterdam in the library,
    Paulina fetched it and set about interrogating the postmark for clues as
    to the business of the area from which the letter had been dispatched.
    From what she could gather, the district around the post office indicated
    was comprised mainly of the residences of professional people some of whom
    had their business rooms as well as domestic quarters at the same address.
    She looked at the writing on the envelope for signs of a legal hand, for
    example. Oh, but what did she know of such things! Next she tried to match
    the initials on the wax seal with those of the house occupants but this
    produced a list of a dozen possibilities. Among the lawyers, university
    professors, doctors and others on her list one name stood out because it
    alone belonged to a woman.</para>

    <para>Alone and with no occupation to distract her and nothing else to
    give her mind exercise, Paulina began to torment herself with visions of
    Johan in the arms of this unknown woman. As night's dark silence spread
    throughout the house she could no longer curb her imagination. It became
    imperative that she should discover the secret inside the envelope. But
    how to break the wax seal? Would it be better to apply heat to melt the
    wax or cold to harden it? Heat might leave tell tale smears of red and
    blunt the original sharpness of the impressed initials. Cold could only
    come from the employing ice which might melt and leave water marks unlike
    those naturally left by exposure to rain, and in any case it had been dry
    for several days.</para>

    <para>As Paulina turned the envelope over and over in her hands she
    noticed that the edge of the wax seal was slightly detached. Had someone
    else been tampering with it, she wondered? If so, why? The possibility
    that she was not alone in having an interest in the contents of the
    envelope served to fuel Paulina's desire to open it. She placed it on the
    silver plate again then held this over the flame of a candle, thinking to
    protect the paper from smoke yet soften the bottom of the wax seal just
    enough to be able to remove it. Almost immediately the tray got too hot
    for her to hold comfortably so she had to give up on that approach.</para>

    <para>Then it occured to her that, just as the letter had been delivered
    to her in error, so was it believable that she could have opened it in
    error having unthinkingly failed to check that it was, indeed, addressed
    to her. Paulina was pleased with this idea, and in no small measure
    because it would immediately gratify her curiosity. This plan also had the
    benefit of not requiring her to reassemble the letter or conceal that she
    had opened it. Acting upon the impulse, she broke the seal, opened the
    envelope and soon found herself holding the paper it had been protecting
    in her fingers.</para>

    <para>It took a while for her to comprehend what she was looking at, so
    strong had been her conviction that she would find a lover's note. What
    she struggled to make sense of was that this was not, in fact, a letter
    but an account for services rendered. The amount was quite modest so not
    in itself of any significance to her. What more a source of consternation
    was that the name on the paper's heading was that of a doctor and the
    account was for a consultation and the provision of medicines as
    prescribed. But Johan wasn't ill, she felt sure she would have seen signs
    of it if he had been and that he would have consulted their usual doctor
    in Den Haag. Yet, the account brooked no other interpretation. Johan's
    name and address were on it and whatever ailed him had required immediate
    treatment. The fear of johan's infideltity now seemed trivial in
    comparison to the fear that he might be concealing a grave illness from
    her.</para>

    <para>In an instant Paulina's own health worries paled into
    insignificance. Her failure to conceive had led her to consult any and
    every medical person who might be able to find a cure for her empty womb.
    She had submitted to all sorts of unpleasant examinations that had not
    spared her blushes or her discomfort. She had been made to answer
    questions of a most personal nature concerning her relations with Johan,
    including his performance and its outcome. She had received many
    assurances that there was nothing wrong with her and no reason why she
    should not conceive. Unless, one doctor implied, Johan was at fault. To
    her absolute horror, this doctor made the improper suggestion that he
    might father her a child himself. Needless to say, she never returned to
    that particular person.</para>

    <para>Recently she had heard of a new form of treatment at the Zander
    Clinic that was soon to open in Amsterdam. She had made an appointment to
    see Dr Zander in the hope that he would deem her suitable to become one of
    his patients. To her immense relief she found him less concerned than
    other doctors with the details of her marital relations. Instead, he asked
    a lot of questions about her daily routine her answers to which seemed to
    cause him to nod wisely, although he himself said very little and offered
    no diagnosis.</para>

    <para>Instead, at the end of their interview Dr Zander set out a regime of
    exercises using his range of machines that were designed to be suitable
    for ladies since there was no need to remove clothing or become over
    heated. Dr Zander had explained that his course of treatement would
    strengthen the relevant muscles, and here he was mercifully not explicit,
    necessary for ease of reproduction. She was shown photographs of ladies
    demonstrating the machines, appearing to be comfortably seated inside the
    wooden-framed contraptions which, she was assured, were gentle despite
    their size. It all seemed so sensible and straightforward that she was
    looking forward to starting her treatment and hopeful of its
    efficacy.</para>

    <para>Now her hopes for Dr Zander and his machines were as nothing when
    weighed in the balance against her horror at the kind of serious illness
    that could take away Johan's life. Paulina spent the hours of a sleepless
    night re-living every moment of her life with Johan looking for any signs
    of illness. Then she went over it all again for indications that he had
    been unwell but concealed it from her. Throughout their honeymoon he had
    been almost constantly in her company and gave every sign of being in the
    best of health. Since then, when he was at home he had given every
    appearance of rude health leading her to conclude that if he was
    concealing something then he was taking such great pains about it that it
    had to be a terrible thing. Was this the explanation for his
    absences?</para>

    <para>Why was Johan keeping secrets from her? She understood that his
    naval work might require him to be circumspect in what he divulged.
    Secretly she found the possibility that he went on some sort of important
    and covert missions gave him an added aura of masulinity and importance
    that she found arousing. It pleased her to perpetuate this illusion rather
    than the alternative one of another woman, although she knew that there
    was no sound basis for either interpretation of his absences. Now faced
    with concrete evidence suggesting a third possibilty which did not bode
    well for their future, Paulina found herself completely at a loss as to
    what to think, say or do.</para>

    <para>By opening the letter she had burned her bridges and must now
    confess what she had done to Johan. She could try to convince him that she
    had realised her mistake and not read the letter once opened, but even a
    cursory glance would have been enough to give the game away that Johan had
    been seeing a doctor. There was now no going back from a confrontation
    with him on the matter of his health. Now she needed to formulate a plan
    of what she was going to say to him upon his return home and when the
    right moment to say it might be.</para>

    <para>Johan had returned home just before Christmas but so far Paulina had
    not found the right moment to hand him the doctor's account and to make
    her carefully rehearsed speech to him. At first she had not wanted to
    spoil their delight at reunion, then they had become caught up in the
    celebration of Christmas and a round of social engagements that was now
    culminating in a grand party to give thanks for the year departing and in
    anticipation of all the blessings in the year to come. Yet Paulina felt
    burdened with worries that she had been unable to lighten by sharing and
    which left her feeling alone in the midst of company.</para>

    <para>It did not escape Marcellus that hiis daughter was somewhat distant
    from the mood of the festive party. An ebullient person himself, he had
    usually been able to lift her out of her tendency to melancholy by the
    generous application of his own good humour. But they had grown apart a
    little since her marriage and she has come to have concerns that were
    private from him. She now found that she was unable to respond to him as
    she once did, which was painful to her as she could see that he was at a
    loss as to how to change his bantering to suit the inevitable shift in
    thie relationship now that she was a married woman. What was more, Paulina
    could tell that Marcellus was distracted by cares of his own that even his
    well-practiced public persona could not conceal from her.</para>

    <para>The source of these cares was not hard to find. There was no getting
    away from the fact that Oma was failing and, looking back on the last
    year, had been increasingly prone to sudden falls although, mercifully,
    she had never injured herself seriously. Yet each time she had taken
    longer to recover from the bumps and bruises, relying more and more on her
    nurses to get through each day. Her mental world had shrunk as much as her
    physical world so that now her attention could only be persuaded to focus
    on her own immediate concerns and a few accounts of past events that were
    worn to word perfection in the repeated telling. Nobody appeared able to
    distract, much less interest her, to the extent that Paulina sometimes
    wondered if Oma really knew who she was any more.</para>

    <para>May God punish her for the thought but old people perish and Paulina
    wished for Oma's end to be soon, swift and easy rather than a long,
    drawn-out decay as the remaining strength of her body fought to keep
    captive the last whisp of a spirit that had already largely departed.
    Surely her father was preparing himself for whatever course Oma's last
    weeks and months might take and the inevitable conclusion. Unless Paulina
    was very much mistaken, her father had something more serious on his mind
    irectly upon their returnthan old Oma's health.</para>

    <para>The reason for her father's disquiet soon became apparent to Paulina
    as she took Johan's arm to follow her parents into the Grote Salon for
    dinner. This was the first time for a long while that she had really
    looked at her mother and was shocked to see how old and worn out she had
    become and how she seemed to need to lean on her father for physical
    support. A great wave of anxiety passed over Paulina as, on top of all her
    other worries, she now understood that there was something amis with hreer
    mother's health. She had been half expecting Oma to be showing signs of
    her mortality but for her mother to be treading the same path did not bear
    thinking about.</para>

    <para>What Marcellus could see and Paulina could not was the toll that
    Paulina's marriage and Oma's decline had taken on Maria's health. Without
    Paulina's constant presence and able assistance the extra work Maria now
    undertook in the management of their business and estate affairs was
    gradually draining her strength. That he had married a woman some years
    his senior who was now herself becoming elderly was making itself evident
    as she tired more easily and seemed to be losing the sharp edge of her
    aptitude and acumen in managing their affairs. Yet she was still as able
    as ever at organising the social events that were such an intergral and
    important part of his political career. But even in this sphere she was
    under added pressure now that his mother's decline was putting her in the
    way of extra work and worry in the management of the household.</para>

    <para>He had lain awake at nights trying to come up with a way to give his
    wife an easier life. Every plan that he had contrived so far had involved
    Paulina's return to he family house. He had entertained the hope that
    giving him a grandchild and heir would rouse in her the sort of familly
    feeling that would make it easier for him to persuade her to come back to
    Haastrecht. Now he was starting to consider what else might prove
    incentive enough to persuade her away from city life in Den Haag. Of
    course, it wasn't just Paulina that he had to take into consideration but
    also Johan, a man whose lifestyle was a mystery to him being so very
    different from anything Marcellus could relate to. He searched his mind
    for anything they might have in common on which to attempt to build an
    alliance. This train of thought at least had the advantage of giving him
    the feeling that there was something he could do to achieve the end he
    desired, even though he did not yet know what it might be.</para>

    <para>Had Paulina but known it, Marcellus had a lift to his shoulders as
    he led the way into dinner as a result of feeling that he had some measure
    of control over the worrying developments in his domestic life. More
    usually of late he had exhibited an air of dejection about his posture
    which would have further upset Paulina had she witnessed it.</para>

    <title/>

    <para/>

    <para>Before she and Johan left to return to Den Haag Paulina made sure
    that she found an opportunity to speak privately with her father. He did
    not take much persuading to share his anxiety about the state of her
    mother's health and they fell to discussing remedies for the overwork
    which they both thought was at the bottom of her physical decline. Paulina
    quickly pledged to spend more time at Haastrecht in order to relieve her
    mother of as much of her work as she would allow. Johan would understand
    and her romantic steak envisaged that their letters and his visits might
    bring reawaken the internsity of their courtship.</para>

    <para>As well as a permanent lightening of her duties, father and daughter
    also agreed that Maria would need some period of rest and recuperation to
    restore her to her previous state of health. Their discussion moved on to
    how to persuade Maria to take a complete break from her duties, something
    which she was unlikely to do, or be given the peace to do, unless she was
    away from home and and all its demands for a while. They considered which
    of their relatives and friends might be able to give Maria the peace and
    tranquility she would need for her recovery and who she would not mind
    being lodged with. It went against the grain for either of them to think
    of asking a favour of even the closest of relations and they knew that
    Maria would hate to be put in the position of self-invited guest, nomatter
    how weighty the reason behind it. Then Paulina recalled hearing talk of
    the benefits to be gained from visiting the mineral spas in Germany whose
    names all seemed to begin with Bad. Her father greeted this suggestion
    with enthusiasm and undertook to speak to their doctor about which of the
    many cures he would recommend for Maria.</para>

    <para>Directly upon their return to Den Haag Johan and Paulina went to
    their separate quarters to await the announcement of dinner, as had become
    their domestic habit. However, on this occasion Paulina soon came to the
    conclusion that she would have to instigate some sort of discussion with
    her husband about the several matters that were weighing heavily on her
    conscience. The couple were not accustomed to sitting down together for
    the purposes of having a serious conversation about the state of their
    private affairs as a result of which a joint view or mutually agreed
    course of action might emerge. Instead, they each went their own way, as
    Paulina had envisaged they would, only informing each other of what they
    were doing as a matter of courtesy and only when necessary at that. Now
    Paulinia had to overcome her anxious state and find a way to take the
    initiative in engagaing Johan in a conference.</para>

    <para>She sent her maid to set out a tray of drinks in the salon in order
    to tempt Johan into accepting her invitation to join her there. Having
    dispatched her maid with this invitation, Paulina did her best to smooth
    her appearance and cool her head before going to the salon to wait for
    him. Johan found his wife's invitation slightly odd but he did not
    hesitate to rise to what he decided to take at face value as being a
    social approach with the added bonus of alcohol on offer. He arrived at
    the salon to find his wife looking more ill at ease than welcoming.</para>

    <para>Paulina struggled to keep her composure and not show her impatience
    as Johan fussed over glasses, decanters, bottles and cigars whilst making
    easy small talk. At last they were seated either side of the fire place in
    the apparent ease of a settled married couple and Paulina looked for an
    opportunity to shift the ground of their encounter and reveal the motive
    to her invitation. Taking advantage of a lull in Johan's chatter as he lit
    a taper from the fire and applied it to his cigar, Paulina gathered
    herself and began the speech which she had carefully prepared
    beforehand.</para>

    <para>"My dear, there are some matters about which we should have a
    serious discussion. Mainly they concern my mothger's health - and
    yours."</para>

    <para>Her last two word suddenly caught Johan's attention, an expression
    wavering between guilt and bewilderment passing across his face. Without
    pausing to give him a chance to speak, she produced the letter containing
    the doctor's bill from her skirt pocket as she continued;</para>

    <para>"Let us take this latter concern first, then. This letter addressed
    to you found its way among correspondence sent to me and I confess to
    opening it in error, not having read the envelope carefully enough. I find
    its contents rather disturbing."</para>

    <para>Handing the item in question over to its rightful recipient, she
    continued;</para>

    <para>"Disturbing on two counts. First, that you are ill and, second, that
    you have hidden this fact from me."</para>

    <para>Here she deliberately paused to give Johan time to open and read the
    doctor's invoice then come up with a response to her raising of the
    matter. She waited longer than was entirely comfortable as it seemed to
    her that Johan was visibly struggling to compose himself.</para>

    <para>"I am deeply ashamed that you have caught me out in a small
    dishonesty in concealing this from you. But, in my defence, the
    consultation alluded to in this invoice revolved around such a trivial
    ailment that it must have slipped my mind to tell you of it."</para>

    <para>"so, my dear, whatever is the matter that you could not see our own
    doctor?"</para>

    <para>"let me assure you that there is nothing sinister about my action.
    Merely the convenience of going to a doctor well versed in the disorders
    common among memebers of the marine. Something that I contracted during my
    time at sea sometimes threatens to recurr and did so whilst I was visiting
    Gillis so I sought out a medical man I had consulted in the past who is
    familiar with such problems and their treatment. Please be ressured that
    it signifies nothing at all serious or of any danger to you."</para>

    <para>Paulina was a bit thrown by the gravity of his last remark but did
    not question it as she was preoccupied with her own pressing
    concerns.</para>

    <para>"I have to ask: Might it have a connection to our failure to produce
    children, and does it have anything to do with your absences from home
    about which you tell me so little?"</para>

    <para>This double question came as a challenge to Johan, its boldness
    aiming directly at two matters of such a private nature that he found
    himself suddenly off guard and on the defensive. The first question was
    simply too intimate and threatening to his masculinity for him to be able
    to take in, never mind address thoughtfully. The second question defaulted
    as the lesser of two evils but still defied his considered reply. Instead,
    Johan found that he had made a snap decision to trust his wife's
    discretion if he confided in her the reasons for his secretive absences
    with not a little desire that this would distract her from persuing and
    answer to her first, and simpler, question.</para>

    <para>"What I have to tell you must not be divulged or even hinted at to
    another living soul. Before I begin, do you swear to me that you will
    never betray the confidence which I am about to put in your discretion,
    not even to allude to what I am about to tell you when you write in your
    journal?"</para>

    <para>"Oh my goodness! This sounds grave indeed!"</para>

    <para>"Do I have your word?"</para>

    <para>"The swear it!"</para>

    <para>"Johan, you are frightening me!"</para>

    <para>"I have good reason for this. Do you swear secrecy?"</para>

    <para>"Yes, then, I swear on my life that I will keep what you tell me
    hidden inside and not whisper a word of it."</para>

    <para>"Good. I am sorry to upset you but you will soon see why it was
    necessary.</para>

    <para>I am often called away on matters of importance to our country and
    its international affairs. I can give no better illustration than what is
    about to occur. But before I go any further, may I ask if I am correct in
    surmising that you also wish to talk to me about your mother's health and
    your desire to spend a good eal of time in Haastrecht with the aim of
    easing her burden of work?"</para>

    <para>Paulina nodde in assent, realizing that her account of her talk with
    her father which she had given to Johan during their journey home would
    have made him aware of the topic she was hoping to broach with him
    later.</para>

    <para>"I should tell you that I, too, have to be away from home and that
    my business may take some time. You may have heard or read in the
    newspapers that Prussia is likely to defeat France in the current war
    between them. This will result in the unification of all the German states
    creating a lengthy border between us and them. Feeling empowered by their
    success over the Fench, it is feared that their attention may next turn to
    encroaching on our territory.</para>

    <para>As far as my involvement goes, there is a fear that the Prussian
    navy will make an incursion into the Friesian Islands and threaten our
    trade routes to the Zuiderzee and north coat ports, perhaps even beyond.
    As we speak, I am awaiting a summons to join the Dutch fleet bound for the
    waters off Denmark."</para>

    <para>Paulina interrupted with a question she just had to know the answer
    to;</para>

    <para>"Will the summons come in the shape of that peculiar little man I
    catch sight of fromn time to time? He never looks the same twice running
    but you alwaysnseem to go away just after I glimpse him."</para>

    <para>"Yes. he is an agent of the Rpyal Family and usually so discrete as
    to barely visible. It was extraordinarily observant of you to notice him
    and clever of you to connect him with my departures."</para>

    <para>"Johan, I have been so anxious about what clandestine purposes lie
    beneath these brief desertions that I have become extremely vigilant for
    any sugns that might point to an explanation of what is going on."</para>

    <para>"Such as a letter? Or going through my things?"</para>

    <para>Now it was Paulina's turn to feel embarrassed.</para>

    <para>"Oh, my love, please do not concern yourself! It isflattering and
    reassuring that you still care so much since our marriage has had its
    disappointments for you, I know. I admire your initiative in spying on me
    and your bravery in confronting me today. I like you the better for
    it."</para>

    <para>There was a brief lull in their talk as each adjusted their
    understanding of the other and took in the shift to a more open basis to
    their relationship now that things had been said which were previously
    left unsaid. Johan took a long draught of his drink and a pull on his
    cigar as he ordered his thoughts and considered how best to
    continue.</para>

    <para>"I have a special talent which the marine has serious need of.
    Although I left the service some time ago, I am honour bound to answer the
    King's call whenever it comes. This is how I remain entitled to still wear
    my uniform whenever I so choose.</para>

    <para>Oh, don't look so surprised, my dear. I know that I must seem a dull
    wit when held up to the men in your family, but I am not totally lacking
    in intellect. I have a gift with maps: reading them, interpreting the land
    and sea scape depicted by them and for making maps which others can easily
    comprehend. This is of strategic importnace for the defence of our country
    and for the conduct of international affairs.</para>

    <para>My next mission will involve me in a detailed survey and mapping of
    the area at risk from the Prussian navy. The aim is to determine where a
    fleet might penetrate our defences, where a ship might hide itself close
    to land, where a boat might land a spy or armed forces, and so on. My
    cartography is needed in these matters and is of importance in deciding
    how we might deploy our own forces defensively."</para>

    <para>Paulina hardly dare ask the obvious question;</para>

    <para>"Will you be in danger?"</para>

    <para>Johan paused before answering, briefly pondering how truthful he
    should be, not wanting to worry Paulina then realizing that she would
    worry nomatter how he played down the risk.</para>

    <para>"I will be honest with you, my love. Yes, there will be some danger
    involved over and above the usual perils of the sea. As I said, there is a
    war and both Prussia and France have their spies about who will use force
    against anyone seen as thwarting their efforts at gaining advantage. There
    is always a chance that we will run into trouble despite our best efforts
    to be clandestine and cautious. I am not a reckless man so I shall be as
    careful of myself as is consistent with achieving the desired
    ends."</para>

    <para>"And will this work require you to be away from home for
    long?"</para>

    <para>"Again, I'm afraid that I must answer in the affirmative. There is a
    lot of coast and sea to map with many islands, sandbanks and complex tide
    lines to be accurately rendered. Some of these are subject to alteration
    by the action of the sea so will need to be charted again and again to
    maintain accuracy. Our mission also involved reporting on any unusual
    vessels or activity, which will also keep us at sea for long periods. You
    will by now appreciate that all of this means that I shall be unable to
    send word to you or receive any of your dear letters.</para>

    <para>So, it is for the best that you go to Haastrecht where you will be
    occupied and thus somewhat distracted from concerns about me. You will
    have the comfort and support of your family and friends ad the
    satisfaction of knowing that you are doing all you can for Maria and
    Oma."</para>

    <para>A rapid succession of thoughts and feelings swept through Paulina as
    she grappled with a new understanding of her husband and an altered
    appreciation of her marriage. Now that Johan had explained everything she
    found that she felt less rather than more anxious. Now that her suspicions
    about his infidelity had been laid to rest she felt a sense of relief that
    their marriage was not under threat. More than that, she found her
    feelings for her husband were strenghthening now thathe was turning ouit
    to be a gifted man who was engaged in important work in the service of
    their King and country. It must be admitted that her pride in being his
    wife was starting to tarnish as he had every appearance of lacking any
    occupation. Being raised to hard work as a duty it had been hard for not
    to think less of him for his seeming idleness. She was overcome by a
    sudden rush of love and desire for him that reminded her of their
    courtship and the best parts of their honeymoon.</para>

    <para>Johan, of course, discerned the subtle alteration in his wife which
    signalled the re-awakening of her desire. He rose and fetched her a small
    glass of the red vermouth she had a afondness for, taking the opportunity
    to lean close to her as he handed her the drink. He rested his hand
    lightly on her shoulder for a few seconds, laying the groundwork for later
    intimacies.</para>

    <para>The tie for deep conversations thus reached its conclusion without
    further concerns surfacing. Paulina would have liked to return to the
    theme of their childlessness but feared that crossing the bounds of
    delicacy, even between husband and wife, might destroy the atmosphere of
    closeness which had developed between them during the course of the
    evening. The prospect of a prolonged separation, entailing Johan's absence
    from her bed, was setback enough to her hopes of motherhood, although she
    knew that this could not be helped.</para>

    <para>On Johan's part, he was all too willing to let the subject of his
    medical situation drop. It had given him a nasty moment when Paulina
    produced the doctor's bill and he had had to think on his feet to come up
    with some sort of plausible explanation for it. He hadn't exactly lied in
    what he had said, but he hadn't been entirely honest either. But, a risk
    of discovery past is a risk forgotten so his mind focussed on managing a
    smooth progress towards bedding Paulina.</para>

    <para>Joahn's sea chest had stood next to Paulina's trunks and boxes in
    the voorkammer of Van den Boschstratt 12 as the couple made their
    farewells on a freezing January morning. Four months had now passed since
    that day when the Den Haag house had been shut up and Paulina moved back
    to the family home in Haastrecht. Paulina had gradually taken over her
    mother's tasks as Maria's poor health forced her to relinquish them bit by
    bit. Once settled back into her old room, Paulina had found it easy to
    fall back into the old routines and habits of the Haastrecht life she had
    led before her marriage. Indeed, she found that for long periods she could
    forget that she was married, especially with the added burden of all her
    mother's work. This state of affairs made it easier to bear the total
    absence of any communication for Johan and distracted her from her anxiety
    for his safety. From time to time she felt a pang of remorse at just how
    easily she had abandoned her recent life style which made her feel as
    though she had rejected her marriage to Johan.</para>

    <para>For all that, things at the Bisdom van Vleit house were not quite
    the same as they had been two years previously, and not just because
    Paulina herself had been changed by her married life (how?). She found her
    father to be even more busy with his Rotterdam business interests which
    were causing him some concern since profits were not holding up as well as
    he wpuld have hoped. At home, his political involvements were not pleasing
    everyone locally so he had found himself the subject of a number of
    ungrateful lampoons. His progressive ideas for land drainage did not meet
    with universal favour, especially his plans for the installation of steam
    pumping engines. He was encountering resistance to such technological
    advances so keeping this project moving forward required his constant
    vigilance and the devotion of both time and energy in chivying people
    along in order to get the work done.</para>

    <para>Once Paulina was installed and doing everything that was required it
    was time to arrange a spa cure for Maria, whose complaints were
    problematically hard to specify that the type of cure that would benefit
    her was not easy to identify. She said that she lacked her usual energy
    and certainly seemed to need to rest more than ever before. Her appetitie
    was sometimes slight so she was becoming thinner and suffered with
    irregularity in her habits. Climbing the stairs made her gasp for air yet
    she had no cough. The doctor could find no diagnosis and wondered aloud if
    she might simply be affected by a nervous disorder. Paulina thought this
    unlikely as her mother had always been a strong woman although she had to
    concede that her mother had been working increasingly hard, as her own
    experience of stepping into her shoes attested. Eventually they settled on
    Bad Ems as the solution beacause of its ease of access by train, spa
    waters efficacious for chest and digestive problems, stunning environment
    and social cachet. The end of the Franco-Prussian War in early May meant
    that travel across the border was once again reliable and safe So,
    preparations completed, Paulina and her father saw Maria and her entourage
    off with high hopes for the benefits of the cure before both returned to
    their duties.</para>

    <para>Paulina soon received a letter from her mother giving an account of
    the regime at her hotel. It did not sound either very appealing or very
    restful and Paulina was glad that she did not need such a 'cure'. The day
    began with a glass of water from the Kraechenbrunnen spring to aeraeted he
    mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and a glass from the
    Kesselbrunnen spring to stimulate the secretions of the digestive tract.
    The action of the latter was assisted by a gentle stroll beside the River
    Lahn whose real attraction seemed to come from the opportunity to spot the
    royalty and famous artists from europe and beyond who happened to be in
    town at the time. More water was drunk before lunch and in the late
    afternoon with further application of spa waters through inhalation and
    warm baths. Eating and socialising, it seemed, left little time to retreat
    to the quiet of her room. At the conclusion of her letter, Paulina's
    mother sought to reassure her that she was confident in the positive
    effects of the cure over the ensuing weeks.</para>

    <para>It was shortly after this letter that word reached Paulina and
    Marcellus that Maria had been unable to complete her stroll in the spa
    gardens despite the assistance of a walking stick and the support of her
    maid. A bath chair had been sent for and she had not felt up to leaving
    her room since having been helped back to the hotel. Paulina an her father
    made arrangements to go to Bad Ems to see Maria but felt no sense of
    urgency or gravity about their visit, each convincing the other that
    Maria's collapse was to be explained by the results of all her exertions
    at home finally catching up with her now that she could relax at last. The
    reality was that by the time Maria had arrived in Bad Ems it was already
    too late for her to recover.</para>

    <title/>

    <para>Paulina and her father arrived in Bad Ems fully expecting to witness
    Maria making steady improvement as the cure combined with complete rest
    had their beneficial effects. Once Paulina saw the Bad Ems for herself she
    was even more convinced of its restorative properties. Here the River Lahn
    flowed through a steep, wooded valley between the Westerwold and Taunus
    mountains providing a magnificent backdrop to the town. A striking river
    frontage had been created by the architecture of the Staadsbad, Kursaal
    and Casino as well as the opulent hotels all aound. Grand villas were
    colonising the less sunny southern bank and churches of all denominations
    seemed to be springing up everwhere to cater for the varied spiritual
    needs of the shifting population. She quickly determined that such
    physical beauty combined with a tranquil ambience could not fail to
    restore her mother in both mind and body.</para>

    <para>Indeed, her mother rallied upon their arrival, managing to eat a
    little of the delicious food on offer as well as drinking the prescribed
    glasses of mineral waters. She seemed to rest peacefully in her room after
    meals, so Paulina and her father ocupied themselves with outings which
    took them increasingly further away from the hotel. At times, she even
    felt as though she were on an adventurous trip just like her excursion
    through the Alps or her honeymoon. She forgot about her mother's state of
    health for hors at a time so preoccupied was she with all the new
    experiences Bad Ems and its surrounding brought to her.</para>

    <para>At first, Paulina and her father took strolls around the town where
    everywhere they encountered fashionably dressed members of Europe's
    royalty, aristocracy and wealthy classes could be seen taking the air on
    the riverside promenades or exploring the many other attractions on offer.
    Paulina found herself even more fascinated by the less regal and more
    unusual residents of the town. Chatting with new acquaintances, she
    discovered that a number of well-known writers and artists were there to
    take advantage of the creative atmosphere and ready source of patronage.
    The lone, tall stooping figure of Turgenev, and the more attractive
    Dostoyevsky accompanied by his second wife, Anna, were pointed out to her
    as memeber sof the Russian crowd. However, most of the whisperings amongst
    her fellow guests related to craggy old Richard Wagner and his wife,
    Cosima, more than twenty years youger than him, and the scandal
    surrounding their previously adulkterous relationship and brood of
    illegitimate children. The rather gruff-looking Victor Hugo was said to be
    taking the cure to aid his recovery from near starvation during the
    Prussian siege of Paris during which, paulina was alarmed to learn, he was
    forced to eat animals from the zoo. She listened with mounting horror to
    the romantic story of the death of his favourite daughter when she fell
    out of boat into the River Seine and was drogged under the water by the
    weight of her sodden skirts, her young husband joining her in death as he
    entered the water trying to save her.</para>

    <para>Exploring further, they climber up to the Concordiaturm to enjoy the
    splendid view of the Lahn valley from the viewing platform atop the tower.
    Paulina found this excursion quite exhausting so was glad that the next
    trip was by boat along the river followed by a train journey further along
    the Lahn Valley Railway. The train took them to the city of lLmburg, the
    track winding along beside the river, halting at seven stations before
    their detsination. There was plenty of beautiful scenery to admire from
    the carriage window, but the elevn tunnels which interrupted the view
    provided a modicum of thrill also.At Limburg they hired a cab to drive
    them around the</para>

    <para>The Altstadt ("Old Town") boasts a fine cathedral and is full of
    narrow streets with timber-frame houses, dating mainly from the 17th and
    18th centuries. That's why it is located on the German Timber-Frame Road.
    Limburger Dom, one of the most complete creations of Late Romanesque
    architecture. It was printed on the reverse of the 1,000 Deutsche Mark
    note from the second series,[2] which was in circulation from 1960 to
    1989. The cathedral was recently renovated and painted to reflect its
    original appearance. Limburger Schloss, built in early 13th century by
    Gerlach von Ysenburg Burgmannenhaus, built about 1544; serves as a museum
    today St. Anna-Kirche (church), stained glass from third fourth of 14th
    century with eighteen scenes from the New Testament Old Lahn Bridge, from
    1315, place where the Via Publica (road) crossed the Lahn In the Old Town
    stand many timber-frame houses from the 13th to 19th centuries. One
    peculiarity seen among the timber-framed houses of Limburg is the "hall
    house" from the High Middle Ages, which has a great hall on the ground
    floor. When restoration work began in the Old Town in 1972, the houses
    were carefully restored. Among the best known timber-frame houses are:
    Haus Kleine Rütsche 4, narrowest spot on the historic trade road between
    Frankfurt and Cologne, whose breadth is written at the Haymarket
    (Heumarkt) in Cologne Haus der sieben Laster (“House of the Seven Vices”)
    at Brückengasse 9, built in 1567,[3] timber-frame house with carvings
    showing Christianity's seven deadly sins, namely pride, greed, envy, lust,
    gluttony, wrath and sloth Werner-Senger-Haus, a beautiful stone hall house
    with timber-framed façade dating from the 13th century Houses at the
    fishmarket. The square's name in the 13th century was still Fismart ("Yarn
    Market" or "Wool Market") in the Limburg dialect, and it was the Limburg
    wool weavers' trading centre[4] Römer 2-4-6, Germany’s oldest freestanding
    house; in the garden a mikvah was found Rathaus ("Town Hall"), built in
    1899 "Huttig" (town wall tower remnant) Former noble estate of the Counts
    of Walderdorff at Fahrgasse 5</para>

    <para>They recounted all their adventures to Maria who seemed interested
    in everything they did. Paulina suggested to her father that one of their
    local discoveries might be something that her mother could be persuad,
    Fench ambassador to Prussia, during their famed conversation in the Kupark
    the previous July. Otto Van Bismark's rather manipulative account of what
    was reutedly a very friendly talk was known as the Ems Dispatch, its blunt
    tone was generally regarded as having triggered the Francvo-Prussian was
    that had ended only a metter of days earlier. Maria's doctor was consulted
    about the proposed outing He pronounced that a short excursion in the warm
    summer air and with good company could only do her good as she seemed to
    be on the road to recovery. Paulina's father arranged a dog cart into
    which Maria was helped then, Paulina and her father walking alongside, was
    driven to the very spot where this diplomatic event took place. Now
    confident of the eventual her mother's restored health, Paulina felt
    relaxed and thoroughly entered into the spirit of the afternoon.</para>

    <para>Paulina and her father made arrangements for their return to
    Haastrecht on the following day. As soon as they had made their farewells
    Maria collapsed, exhausted by her efforts on behalf of her husband and
    daughter. She had not wanted them to see how weak and ill she felt as it
    would only cause them to worry and that was pointless as there was nothing
    they, or anybody, could do to change the situation. She soon became
    confined to her room, then took to her bed. The doctors and nurses could
    plainly see that she was slipping away, despite their best efforts and
    previous optimism. Paulina and Macellus had barely had time to settle down
    back at Haastrecht before a further summonds to Bad Ems arrived. Still
    unprepared for the gravity ofthe situation, they made no haste in
    arranging for their return to Bad Ems. On 7th June Maria died quietly and
    alone, aged 67.</para>

    <para>If Paulina had thought herself busy before, then the death of her
    mother left her with not a second to spare in the day. Organising a
    funeral had the added complication of Maria's body being in Ems but her
    burial to take place in Haastrecht, some considerable distance away and
    across the border between two nations. It was agreed that Marcellus would
    return home in order to take up his duties there as best he could in the
    circumstances. Paulina was to remain in Germany to take care of
    formalities there before accompanying her mother's body back to
    Haastrecht. Before his departure Paulina had armed her father with a list
    of things he needed to do once back home but she rather suspected that
    pressing matters of other kinds would distract him from giving her
    instructions his full attention. She was fairly confident that her
    father's friendship with the Pastor and good business relationship with
    their lawyer would progress some matters. What was less certain was the
    commissioning of a new grave stone and the making of arrangements for its
    installation, not to mention the detailed preparations for the interrement
    itself. She would have to keep and eye on him if everything was to go
    smoothly.</para>

    <para>Paulina returned to her hotel room and the many tasks which now vied
    for her time and attention. Etiquette dictated that she should only appear
    in public wearing mourning clothes but she had nothing suitable with her.
    A local seamstress was summoned on the recommendation of the hotel
    manager. The woman gace assurances that she could produce sufficient
    garments to satisfy society by the next day. Measurements were taken,
    fabrics chosen and designs recommended with facilitating a speedy outcome
    in mind. Then the miliner arrived with a selection of appropriate hat and
    veils from which Paulina selected something that would sit as decorously
    as was feasible atop her unruly hair. Fortunately she had gloves and boots
    in black so did not need to trouble herself to acquire these. Attention to
    her appearance was but an irritating interruption to the constant stream
    of correspondence that flowed from Paulina's pen, including instructions
    for further garments and accessories from her own seamstress which were to
    await her arrival back home.</para>

    <para>Having sent out for a quantity of black edged notepaper and
    envelopes, she began the work of writing to all the names on the list of
    family and friends she had compiled, informing them of Maria's passing.
    Once she had word from her father of the date and time of the burial she
    could pass these details on to the close family members who would attend
    the house for prayer and meditation led by the Pastor before moving on to
    the burial itself. Although the family had a vault inside the church, a
    law passed in 1829 forbade further interior burials so Maria would be
    interred just outside the church walls in ground which was once the choir
    of the old church which burnt down in 1624 but was never completely
    re-buit. Hopefully, this would still give access to the family vault just
    the other side of the church wall thus meeting the need of the family
    whilst staying within the law. Oh, how Paulina wished that she could
    include Joahn in her letters! She would just have to make do with dashing
    off notes to her father as matters requiring his attention came to her
    mind.</para>

    <para>It was not all writing, however. There was a doctor to be seen in
    order to obtain a death certificate and medical documents necessary to
    transporting a corpse back to Holland. He did, of course, have to be paid,
    too. Then undertakers were summoned and the business of selecting a
    suitable casket (kist) gone through. Paulina tried to choose something
    which she though would have met with her mother's approval and which
    reflected the family's station in life. The undertaker semed to endorse
    the outcome before departing with haste in order to prepare the deceased
    for her last journey by suitable preservation, dressing her hair and
    applying the make-up which would lessen the waxy look of death and create
    the illusion of a living complexion. Lastly, with the help of his wife, he
    would clothe her in the garments and jewelery which Paulina had provided
    before arrangeing her in the casket and sealing it for
    transportation.</para>

    <para>This final journey itself necessitated a not inconsiderable feat of
    organisation but the undertaker was no stranger to the deaths of
    foreigners in Bad Emms so knew the ropes. First, a hearse and mourner's
    carriage would convey the parties to the railway station, a short distance
    but the proprietes of a glass hearse and black carriage both drawn by
    plumed black horses were observed. A floral tribute of suitable size would
    top the casket and must be made using the most expensive and rare blooms.
    Two chief mourners would walk before the funeral courtage and remain at
    the bereaved's disposal throughout the journey to Gouda where a local
    undertaker would receive the party. Pall bearers would follow the cortege
    ready to transfer the coffin from hearse to train, then between trains at
    Koblenz, Koln and Utrecht. These men would also stand guard outside the
    compartment containing the coffin to ensure the deased's privacy and
    safety. All these mourners would need to be provided with a compartment
    where they could take rest and refreshment on both the outward and return
    legs of their journey. Paulina's own food, drink and personal comfort also
    needed to be arranged. Things began to fall into place when her new
    clothes arrived and were to her liking. Up until now she had not left her
    room so, now that she was suitably attired, she was glad to go out for
    some fresh air and to receive and acknowledge in person the condolences of
    fellow guests. But she only began to properly relax once the travel home
    had all been planned down to the last detail, inlcuding the choice of her
    personal menus and stipulation of her meal times. There were even
    contingencies in place in the event of missed connections, inefficiencies
    on the part of railway staff or other unforseen delays.</para>

    <para>It was a long, grim day for Paulina as she accompanied her Mother's
    casket (kist) back to Gouda during which she retreated into herself. Her
    habitual recourse of writing in her journal, composing poetry and writing
    letters to her friends was denied her by the jolting and swaying of the
    train which rendered even her large and fluid script distorted into
    illegibility. Even the diversion of reading was denied her as focussing on
    the unstable page brought on feelings of nausea, even were she in a frame
    of mind to concentrate on the story. So, she spent most of the journey
    gazing out of the compartment window without registering the changeing
    landscape or the towns and cities passing by.</para>

    <para>Finally arriving at Gouda, her wits were so dulled that she allowed
    herself to be scorted onto the platform by the Chief Mourner on duty and
    passed into the care of his opposite number from the Gouda firm. She felt
    herself being handed on to yet another man who had the boldness to put his
    arm around her shoulder. She suddenly jerked into awareness at this
    unwarranted intrusion upon her person, experiencing a moment of utter
    confusion as a familiar voice struggled for recognition and location in
    the man in such intimate contact with her. It was Theo! At last she could
    let go of the need to hold herself up under the burdens of the previous
    days, weeks and months and relinquish all to Theo's care. It was such a
    relief to find herself safely ensconsed inside The Haven.</para>

    <para>Paulina soon realized that Theo had in fact taken charge of
    everything at Haastrecht. He had taken Marcellus to The Haven and she was
    shocked to see him looking so worn and ashen, barely able to raise a smile
    at the sight of his daughter. It seems that he had been carrying out his
    business and public duties as usual, preferring to keep busy rather than
    sit and rhuminate on his loss.Paulina felt much the same, being of the
    opinion that life goes on and it does nobdy any good to simply succumb to
    emotion. Unfortuntaley, she found that this is just what Aggie had done.
    As soon as she saw her sister, Aggie fell against her in floods of tears,
    clinging to Paulina like a drowning woman. Reluctantly, Paulina put her
    arms around her step-sister and tried to summon the energy to comfort her
    whilst willing her to pull herself together. In the end it was Theo who
    gently detatched his sobbing wife, helped her to a seat in an armchair
    then wrapping her in a shawl and putting her feet up on a footstool. His
    solicitousness caused Paulina a sharp stab of regret that Johan was
    absent.</para>

    <para>As if reading her mind, Theo came to her with an account of the
    efforts which he ahd amade to try and reach Johan through his contacts,
    calling in some of the favours he was owed. Although nothing was certain,
    he had a feeling that a message had reached Johan's ship and that it might
    be possible, but not to raise her hopes too high, that he could be
    discretely landed somewhere. Clearly Thoe knew more about Johan's
    activities than she did, or he had previously divulged, but it did mean
    that he could give her good news about this welfare despite all the other
    uncertainties. For now, it was a relief to Paulina to be back among her
    family with her burden shared.</para>

    <para>Cook had prepared a selection of savouries and cakes for a light
    supper which the maid had laid on a small table in the salon. Theo pressed
    a small glass of sweet wine on both Paulina and Aggies before pouring a
    healthy measure of cognac for Marcellus and himself. The diminished family
    groupArranged themselves around the table then toyed with the food whilst
    managing to make small talk by dint of long-establishes social habit.
    Paulina soon felt her eyelids begining to droop and had to beg to be
    excused to her room. There she found that her own maid from home had
    already laid out her nightgown and prepared hot water so that she may wash
    away the soot of the trains and the grime of travel. Grateful to feel
    clean and be released from her corsets, Paulina was soon fast asleep in
    the arms of a large, soft feather bed.</para>

    <title/>

    <para>In the early hours of the morning word had reached The Haven that
    Johan had arrived at his brother's house and had elected to rest there
    before making the journey to Gouda in time to join the funeral cortege for
    the journey to Haastrecht. Gillis had been shocked by the sight of his
    brother. Unsurprisingly, Johan was salt encrusted, sooty, and generally
    dirty but he also smelled rather repulsively of rancid fish oil, not to
    mention neglected bodily hygeine. But more than this, he looked far more
    unhealthy than could be accounted for by his arduous journey home or the
    rigours and deprivations of life at sea. He had lost weight but that
    wasn't the worst of it. His face beneath the beard growth was covered in
    small ulcers and scabs which he passed off as salt burns from the lashing
    of sea spray whilst on deck. He vehemently denied feeling ill saying that
    he just needed time to recover himself.</para>

    <para>By the time Johan presented himself to Paulina later that morning he
    had bathed, shaved and was dressed in his good, black clothes. A faint
    fishy odour hung about his person despite the liberal application of
    cologne in an attempt to cover it. He had also tried to conceal the mess
    that was made of the skin on his face by shaving across a rash of small
    scabs and lesions by the application of pigmented ointment but this hadn't
    been entirely successful as it created a complexion of a most unnatural
    colour and texture. Furthermore, beneath the fumes of cognac on his breath
    there lurked a rottenness from within. Paulina had expected to fall into
    his arms after so long a separation but found him rather repulsive. He
    didn't force the matter, either, creating an atmosphere of strained
    politeness between them. Paulina wondered just how much he was hoping to
    keep hidden from her than was necessary and despite his protestsations of
    opennes when she had broached the subject of his secrecy back in Den Haag.
    Indeed, she was quite distracted from the purpose of the day, having to be
    shephered through it all by Johan and Theo.</para>

    <para>During the carriage journey to Haastrecht Paulina sat between
    Marcellus and Johan in what promissed to be a leaden silence because of
    the straied atmosphere and the Marcellus's growing morbid pre-occupation
    with the hearse in front of them and the the casket it contained. Then
    Johan suddenly decided to entertain father and daughter with a lively
    account of his tortuous journey back to Gouda. This began with a hazardous
    transfer from his ship to a small, local fishing boat in a rolling sea,
    followed by an uncomfortable run to the fishing port ofZoutkamp on the
    coast to the north of Groningen,. This gave him the opportunity to explain
    away the state of his face by means of a dramatic enactment of being
    repeatedly stung by salt water spray. Once ashore, he had engaged in canny
    negotiations with the skipper of a Tjalk (?) conveying smoked eels to
    market in Groningen before he was granted passage. Keen to be under way,
    the skipper had frustratingly elected to wait for the most favourable run
    of the tide to assist the sails in carrying them along the Reitdiep. Johan
    feared that being in close quarters with the smoked eels for such a length
    of time might have left him with an unfortunate fragrance, a point with
    which father and daughter could only tacitly concur. From Groningen he
    could reached Rotterdam by train but a badly timed conncetion meant that
    this seemed to take forever. After just a short time with his brother, he
    had needed to leave at the crack of dawn to make the train for Gouda in
    order to be in time to be with them before they left for
    Haastrecht.</para>

    <para>Grudgingly, Marcellus and Paulina had been distracted by Johan's
    recounting of his tale, which had managed to consume the whole of the ride
    to Haastrecht. Nevertheless, they were glad to arrive and gain release
    form the close confines of the carriage. The Pastor was waiting at the
    house to greet them, ushering them into the grand salon where Otto and
    Adelaide were waiting. Paulina registered their recoil at the sight of
    Johan in the instant before they regained control of their epressions. She
    surmised that they were thinking that he looked more embalmed than her
    mother, whose closed casket meant that they would not be able to make the
    actual comparison.</para>

    <para>Poor old Oma, who had not expected to outlive one of her sons much
    less her daughter-in-law, was wheeled in by bath chair to join the company
    as they sat round for the Pastor to lead their prayers and prompt the
    direction of their silent contemplations. Then, Oma having fallen asleep,
    was taken back to her room before the rest of the party set out for the
    churchyard. The Pall Bearers hoisted Maria's casket onto their shoulders
    and the Chief Mourner led the sedate procession the short distance to
    where the grave had been opened ready to receive its offering. Judging
    from the most unpleasant smell hanging over the churchyard, the family
    vault had been penetrated allowing Maria to be lowered into the ground to
    join the Bisdom-van-Vliet's who had predeceased her. The Pastor led his
    congregation in the Lord's Prayer before the funeral party turned to
    return to the house allowing the gravediggers to cover the coffin with
    earth and seal in the smell of the stinking rich. Before the family went
    their separate ways to resume their daily lives marcellus laid before them
    a substantial meal accompanied by plenty to drink in order to to sustain
    them for the start of their journey.</para>

    <para>Once Marcellus, Paulina and Johan has bade farewell to the rest of
    the funeral party, a sense of emptiness and malaise afflicted each of
    them. They shared the anti-climax at having no focus for their activities
    and attention now that the event for which they had expended so much
    energy in preparation was over. Now what should they do with themselves?
    Marcellus would ordinarily have gone back to his work but desisted so as
    to honour of the memory of his wife. Paulina was also thinking of what she
    needed to do in order to catch up with the management of the house and
    estates which had surely been neglected during her absence. Mostly,
    though, she was pre-occupied with trying to make sense of the state that
    Johan had got into. As for Johan, he sought to avoid for as long as
    possible the inevitable questioning by his wife, ideally until his skin
    had a chance to heal so that there was no outward sign to give force and
    direction to her inquiries. He wanted to be alone with a few good,
    Haastrecht cigars and a bottle or two of Marcellus's best Cognac.</para>

    <para>After a period of desultry conversation all three agreed that they
    should retire in order to begin the process of recovery from their
    exertions with a period of uninterrupted rest and, hopefully, a good
    night's sleep. Johan took his leave of father and daughter with an almost
    unmannerly haste then shut himself up in his quarters in a way that
    clearly signalled that he did not wish to be disturbed. Marcellus and
    Paulina exchanged glances registering their surprise at Johan's departure
    but they neither discussed nor commented on his motivation. Instead, they
    spent a quiet half hour in reminiscing about Maria whilst permitting
    themselves a few tears for the loss of her. Then, having released the
    tensions of the day, they took their individual thoughts off to
    bed.</para>

    <title/>

    <para>Maria was barely cold in her grave before the churchyard beside her
    was disturbed in preparation for Oma's burial. Once again, the family
    gathered in prayer and reflection at the house. Once again, they stood in
    the churchyard to watch the small coffin containing Oma's shrivelled and
    shrunken corpse being lowered into the foetid extension of the family
    vault. Once again, they dined until replete before going their separate
    ways. But this time there was no subsequent sense of a void left by the
    person now gone. Instead, a sense of relief that was only be tinged with
    sadness. At the age of 84, it had been Oma's time. The force of the woman
    who had ruled the household in the wake of her husband's untimely death,
    had continued to make her presence felt after Marcellus's marriage brought
    another woman into the house and then gone on to hold her own in the trio
    of mother, wife and daughter that followed had long dissipated as she
    became increasingly frail and infirm then, for the most part, confined to
    her room. They had gradually become accustomed to her absence but not
    innured to the growing suffering from which only death had the power to
    relieve her.</para>

    <para>Another difference between Maria's funeral and Oma's came later in
    the day when Paulina and Johan shared the same bed. Over the six weeks
    that intervened between the two funerals Johan's skin had returned to its
    normal condition, he had regained a healthy-looking physique and regained
    the confidence to tackle the demands of marital intimacy, both physical
    and otherwise. The odours about his person had returned to their usual
    combination of cologne, cigars and cognac in various stages of staleness,
    contributing to his person being generally more approachable. Paulina had
    not quite recovered from the horror of the realzation that the skin rash
    attributed to salt burns had, in fact, covered all of his torso as well.
    She was astute enough to see that he had been trying to pass it off as
    something far more trivial than it actually was, and to form the view that
    only some contaigious disease could have led him to keep her at arm's
    length for several weeks. His complete recovery allowed her enough
    optimism to conclude that whatever the illness had been, it was now a
    thing of the past. She could not quite ignore the nagging recollection of
    that invoice from a strange Rotterdam doctor and Johan never quite
    regained even the semblance of his earlier interest in his wife.</para>

    <para>In fact, nothing was ever be the same for the Bisdom van Vliet's
    after Oma's death. Paulina and Johan would soon return to their home in
    Den Haag leaving Marcellus to wander the empty rooms of the old familie
    huis trying to escape the fact that he was now all alone there. Of course,
    it was only right that Paulina should return to her own house, espeially
    now that Johan seemed to have retrned from his duties at sea. Now that
    there was no possibility of Maria ever returning, more permananet
    arrangments had been put in place to cover her roles in managing house and
    estates. A man of business had been engaged for the latter and seemed to
    be keeping on top of things. Marcellus had also taken on a housekeeper
    after interviewing many suitable women but rejecting them all until he
    finally could find no possible grounds on which to continue to deny that
    he needed the services of such a person. So far, these new arrangements
    had been to his satisfaction. Not that he cared much for his domestic
    comfort now that he was bereft of family, but that the management of the
    lands and estates was no longer to be conducted at the grace and favour of
    his daughter came unexpectedly as a relief.</para>

    <para>Paulina was glad to be released from the heavy burdens of filling
    her mother's shoes. She had plenty to manage on her own behalf now that
    her mother's will had been enacted. Maria had bequeathed her five houses,
    two warehouses, two farms, five orchards, a mill, a stable and meadow and
    hay lands so she was a woman of property in her own right now, although in
    a modest way compared to her father's property and lands. She felt that
    she had neglected her friends over the past months and wanted, neigh
    needed, to see them again to gain succour from their amity. before they
    left Haastrecht she took the oppportunity to spend some time first with
    Mientje Blanken, whom she considered to be her very best friend, then with
    Helena and Cornelia Droost. Their sympathy with her loss gave her much
    succour which itself helped her to put her worries about Johan into some
    sort of perspective, although she did not divulge any hint of her marital
    situation to her spinster friends.</para>

    <para>All too soon, Paulina and Johan departed for Den Haag leaving
    Marcellus feeling very alone in the rambling, old familie huis. In a
    matter of a few months he had gone from feeling his life complicated by
    the presence of three women in his home to missing their company and the
    civilising touches a woman brought to the house. He wandered through the
    rooms now devoid of human occupancy since even the servants kept away,
    there being little for them to do most of the time, almost feeling a
    stranger in his own home. It was as if the house no longer belonged to him
    and he began to see it as an outsider might. The old rooms were now so
    outdated that they could almost be museum exhibits. Even the new part of
    the house seemed slightly shabby and old-fashioned as the sunlight through
    the windows threw a spotlight onto every little scuff and stain. He took
    his meals alone, as he had done many times recently, but now he knew there
    was no Oma dozing in her room and no Maria to return to him from an erand
    or visit. Only Paulina remained a possible companion. Whilst she had been
    living back at home he had grown used to her companionship despite her
    morose temperament. Now she had gone back to her life as a married woman
    and some else's companion. He felt bereft.</para>

    <para>His natural recourse in times of personal disquiet was to seek the
    creative upslift he got from his work, from seeing a project through from
    the first idea to the final product. Normal duties were a distraction,
    yes, but now her needed more so he turned his attention to his latest
    grand scheme - the pump house which would keep the polders of Lopikerward
    drained. Marcellus had been working in partnership with Lopik's
    burgermeester to apply a modern solution to the flooding problems in this
    area caused by the conjunction of sinking peatlands and rising river
    levels. The mills had been coping by pushing water into a holding pond
    behind Haastrecht then discharging it into the Hollandse IJssel through
    small locks into the harbour then onto the river. But the mills now needed
    some help, especially when the wind did not blow to turn their
    sails.</para>

    <para>Marcellus had joined a party of dignitaries on a visit to the new
    Cruquius pumping station, one of three that had been built to drain the
    vast Haarlemermeer lake to the south west of Amsterdam. It had been a
    truely inspirational visit, not least because the drainage was the first
    project to be accomplished, not by the use of windmills at all, but soley
    by the use of steam powered pumps. Quite a departure for Dutch drainage
    engineers for which they had the English to thank with their advanced
    steam technology. Once the lake had been enclosed by a retaining dijk, the
    three pump houses had taken moved all the water out into a ring canal in
    just a little over four years. A feat which, until he saw The Hydraulic,
    as they called it, for himself, had seemed impossible to Marcellus and
    made his own battles with flooding polder seem puny in compariason.</para>

    <para>AS the barge conveying the party approached Cruquius along the canal
    their first impression was of a sort of castle but with the addition of a
    tall chimney. The engineer leading the tour explained that the boilers
    were housed in the hall which they could easily have mistaken for a
    medieval great hall, whilst the pumps themselves occupied a crenelated
    round tower beside it. However, the tower had eight great legs sticking
    out evenly around it which moved up and down in a manner that was
    disconcertingly like a vast spider on the move. Of course, the tower stood
    still and these legs were, in fact, the driving beams and piston links.
    The tour of the inside of the pumping station compounded the impression of
    animus as the boilers and steam engines roared, hissed and snorted. The
    amount of water that this working monster could move with the combined
    efforts of the eight pistons would have beggared belief had Marcellus not
    seen it with his own eyes. He found the whole experience exhilarating to
    the verge of frightening. It did, however, open his eyes to the power of
    steam which he now championed as the solution to the local problems back
    at home.</para>

    <para>He could not as single-mindedly apply steam engines to the drainage
    of the troublesome polders of Lopikerward as the engineers of
    Haarlemmermeer had for a number of reasons. Marcellus realized that his
    own reluctance to abandon the use of windmills, which had been tried and
    tested across the centuries, would be echoes by the people of the Vlist.
    Replacing the mills for a new-fangled and alien mechanical contrivance was
    a risk to great to be contemplated by the ordinary man. The workings of
    the machinery would be unknown territory for them, alomost like a magic
    trick moving the water around - or something biblical. They would fear
    what they didn't undertsand rather than embrace it. The value of steam
    pumping needed to be demonstrated in action so that it might become
    commonplace and no longer a mystery. Although he had been assured of the
    reliabilty of these engines, what if the machine did break down? He would
    need to find at least one local man who would be willing to learn not only
    how to operate the engine but also how to maintain and, if necessary,
    repair it. Meanwhile, the current mill workers should be reassured that
    they were not about to be deprived of their livelihoods and homes in short
    order. There had been many reports of workers dispalced by machinery
    seeking terrible revenge on their masters and their infernal engines. The
    change to steam needed to be accomplished gradually and the support of the
    millers courted along the way.</para>

    <para>But now, in his bereavement, Marcellus threw his engeries into the
    Haastrecht steam pump project. He haunted the architects of the buildings
    which would house the pump and the man who would operate it. The pump
    itself was being made in Cornwall and he contemplated paying a visit to
    the engineering company there but, in the end, decided that it was too
    long a journey to make and would necessitate too long an absence from home
    so reluctantly abandoned the idea. Maps and calculations absorbed him as
    he went over the plan and the predicted benefits that it would deliver. He
    kept upwith his business and political interests yet the new drainage
    system was there to fill the void left by the absence of his three
    women.</para>

    <para>He was also prone to distracting himself with pondering the state of
    his daughter's marriage which he could easily have worked himself up into
    a state of worry over. She seemed unable to settle down to life in Den
    Haag despite her husband being home from his wanderings permanently, or so
    it would seem. Paulina seemed to be busying herself with social activities
    which her husband seemed not to share in. Marcellus found that he was none
    too keen on Johan, although he was hard pressed to put his finger on quite
    why this should be. The chap seemed friendly enough but there was
    something a bit off kilter about him. A recently received letter had
    brought this feeling of unease to the front of Marecllus's mind as it
    seemed to typify something vaguely distasteful about the man.</para>

    <para>For a start, Johan had addressed him as "Valued Papa" which seemed a
    little too familiar to Marcellus. Although Johan had lost his own father
    when just a boy and perhaps had a need for a father figure even now he had
    grown to a man approaching middle years, Marcellus felt uncomfortable at
    being thrust into his shoes. The text itself began with some talk of
    business in the form of the mortgage value of a polder near Middleburg,
    the ledgers relating to Hilletje and some matters concerning wills which
    left Marcellus wondering why he needed to know all this. What was of more
    interest was a passage reporting the couple's good health and the
    curtailing of their pleasure in Den Haag and Scheveningen by the inclement
    weather. It seemed that Paulina's friend, Jenny van Zijll, was visiting
    them but due to leave imminently. Johan said no more about her visit. More
    appositely, he made no concession to Marcellus's situation as doubly
    bereaved. In fact, Marcellus found it in rather poortaste that Johan went
    on to end his letter with ab extensive account of Utrecht gossip
    concerning a man marrying a beautiful girl 35 years his junior ( was that
    a hint to Marcellus to followsuit) and a couple who wed againts the wishes
    of her family which ended with the jilted groom trying to drown himself by
    jumping from the Hoornbrug (gain in bad taste considering Marcellus's own
    losses). Somehow Marcellus felt that the final salutation from "Your
    loving son" was rather overblown. However was his daughter faring in a
    marriage with someone so lacking in sensitivity to others and so keen to
    inflate his emotional connections to them?</para>

  <title>Summer 1872(3)</title>

  <section>
    <title/>
    <para>The arrival of Theodorus Hooft caused something of a stir amongst
    the inhabitants of Haastrecht. There had, of course, been rumours that a
    new family had taken a house just beyond the sluis which could be
    interpreted as indicating that they are clearly not patrician or even
    simply wealthy. On the other hand, they were not simple folk who tended to
    live even further out along the dyke in dwellings which could only be
    described as basic or even hovels. The labouring population was almost
    entirely made up of folk born and raised in the village or who had married
    into these local families, but the Hoofts were clearly incomers, thus of
    great concern. The consensus among the watchers had to be that newcomers
    fell somewhere in between the Bisdom van Vliets and the common folk,
    likely the man of the family would be some sort of tradesman.</para>

    <para>Grist to the rumour mill came from the Straver family of carpenters
    who had let it be known that they had been approached by 'building
    interests in Den Haag' with a view to engaging one of them in a 'grand and
    important' local construction project. Details of the Den Haag end of
    things were few and far between, the Straver family being more exercised
    with spreading it about that young Cornelis Straver, at the age of only
    18, was to be given the honour of being a senior journeyman on this
    project. Details of the who, what, when and where of the putative
    construction remained the subject of much inventive conjecture. Thus, as
    soon as a stranger, accompanied by a woman and child, came into view on
    the dyke top word soon spread and people materialised at every vantage
    point to inspect the newcomers and their cart load of possessions as they
    steadily made their way towards their new home.</para>

    <para>As soon as the cart had come to a reliable halt, Theodorus stepped
    down and and raised his arms to help his wife safely down to earth, an
    especially delicate task since, as all could plainly see, she was
    pregnant. Next came a boy of about four who seemed less than keen to
    explore his new home, clinging to his mother's skirt thumb in mouth.
    Having secured his horse, the carter made haste to uncover his cargo and
    carry a chair into the house in order that Mevrouw Hooft might sit and
    recover after their long, uncomfortable journey from Den Haag. A box of
    toys followed in the hope that the young boy might be entertained and not
    get in the way of the men as they unloaded the rest of the family's goods.
    This latter task was arguably facilitated by the many volunteers from
    amongst the curious crowd who would later benefit in the way of kudos,
    taking material form as free food and drink, when disseminating their
    accounts of the family and their things in every detail.</para>

    <para>At last, Theodorus paid the carter and closed the front door on the
    intrusive helpers who had been reluctant to leave. It had been a long day
    indeed! Maria Francina had wanted to supervise the unloading of their
    kitchen equipment, linens and clothing but he had been quite stern about
    making her stay sitting down. Hendrik Willem had been fractious and clung
    to his mother and attempted to do the same to his father, which was rather
    less than convenient He had more than enough to cope with managing the
    location of every unloaded item, especially when people were crowding into
    the small house carrying anything they could lay their hands and requiring
    Theodorus to be in several places at once. He was, frankly, exhausted but
    the day was not over yet as he needed to make a site visit to check on
    progress and make his presence felt among the labourers. It was a
    considerable relief to him when a thoughtful gesture by
    <emphasis>Burgemeester</emphasis> Bisdom van Vliet materialised in the
    shape of two maids who stepped into the middle of the chaos and set about
    making up beds and organising basic kitchen and toileting
    facilities.</para>

    <para>Paulina had never felt so perturbed in all her life, not even when
    she met Johan Jacob. Her uncommon disquiet was compounded by the sensation
    that she was about to be overwhelmed and suffer an uncharacteristic and
    disgraceful public emotional collapse. She desperately cast about for some
    sort of refuge from being exposed to social humiliation. Although she
    would have preferred solitude, nevertheless she was so glad to see her
    friend, Cornelia Droost, making haste in her direction. Allowing herself
    to be guided by Cornelia's hand under her elbow, Paulina entered the cool,
    calm quiet of the Droost house where she was passed into the enveloping
    wings of a plush armchair. Tea was ordered and Helena sent for.</para>

    <para>As the disturbance of her arrival died down, the Droost house tried
    to regain its usual deep silence only punctuated only by the ponderous
    tick of the long case clock in the hall. But not today and a miserable
    Paulina realized that she could still hear the commotion outside from
    which she so badly wanted to escape. Granted, the clamour of destruction
    was now muted by the fabrics and furnishings of the house, yet the sounds
    of wrecking that filtered through retained the power to unsettle her
    spirit. It was incomprehensible yet it manifestly true that the home she
    had grown up in, which had seemed so solid, secure, immutable even, was
    being reduced to unrecognisable chunks of stone and wood accompanied by
    clouds of dust. Oh, so much commotion and chaos! Horrified, she could feel
    herself about to swoon in front of other people, even if they were her
    oldest and best friends.</para>

    <para>When her father had first put forward his scheme to demolish the old
    <emphasis>familie huis</emphasis> his idea was clearly a bold one but, the
    way he presented it, seemed to make sense. His vision was to replace the
    existing arbitrary assemblage of buildings with a single, modern and
    stylish property. Part of his argument was that the old house was woefully
    lacking in domestic comforts and innovations, yet this was true of so many
    properties built by 17th century patricians. Many wealthy families had
    stuck to the Dutch way and periodically made additions and adaptations to
    their old houses thus giving them a new lease of life. It was obvious to
    Paulina and others that something more than replacing an old house, which
    was not exactly falling into ruins, was at work here. Marcellus's next
    point was incontestable. A new house was the way he wished to mark the
    anniversary of his fifty years as <emphasis>burgermeester</emphasis> of
    Haastrecht, which was undoubtedly a momentous achievement worthy of some
    grand gesture. But knocking down buildings which could have been the basis
    for a perfectly good house then to replace them with a completely new one?
    The family were puzzled and dismayed, although they attempted to hide this
    from the proud and elated Marcellus.</para>

    <para>With the utmost secrecy, Marcellus had set about finding an
    architect who was familiar with the new style of houses currently the
    fashion in Den Haag. He wanted something that had the same character as
    Paulina and Johan's new house, on the subject of which he had
    surreptitiously quizzed the couple and received glowing reports. The
    architect paid a site visit to Haastrecht early in 1972 which resulted in
    the advice to build the new house on the footprint of the old one. This
    strategy would avoid the trouble and expense of putting in new wooden
    piles for the foundations since the existing ones were still in good
    condition. It also had the virtue of keeping to the size of the original
    plot thus obviating the need to negotiate ownership of more land from
    adjacent properties. With his brief clearly established, the architect
    soon had a set of plans for the new Bisdom van Vliet house available for
    the perusal of his client.</para>

    <para>Marcellus was delighted with the look of his new house so set about
    finding suitable master craftsmen to build it. He preferred to use local
    men where at all possible, but the architect championed a talented young
    mason and plasterer, Theodorus Hooft, who had experience in the modern
    building techniques currently in demand in Den Haag. Marcellus was
    impressed by Heer Hooft when they met, finding him amiable yet polite.
    They were soon collaborating effortlessly in making a refinements to the
    original plans so as to better fulfil Marcellus's aspirations. The young
    man was also willing to uproot his wife and young son from their home in
    Den Haag and move the family to Haastrecht in order to be near his client
    and his place of work.</para>

    <para>Then came the day when Marcellus, Heer Hooft at his side, called
    together family and friends for a somewhat theatrical unveiling of his
    radical project. He was so delighted with himself and his vision of the
    future that nobody had the courage to challenge his decision, and Heer
    Hooft seemed such a nice young man who had clearly committed so much to
    the project and worked so hard on behalf of his client. In short, the two
    men put up a united and unassailable front.</para>

    <para>Once the cat was out of the bag the gossips got to work. In parlours
    and kitchens all over the Province of South Holland the mention of
    Marcellus was heard to provoke phrases such as:</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hier kan je je ei kwijt ...</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>as a ringleader would invite those around them to openly share their
    opinions on Marcellus's grand plan and "loose their egg here", allegedly
    in private.</para>

    <para>Then someone would venture that,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij heeft een klap van de molen beet!</emphasis>" or
    "<emphasis>Een klap van de molen gehad hebben!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>to convey the view that he was not acting very wisely as though he
    had been "hit by one of the sails on the windmill" and has lost his mind
    as a result of it.</para>

    <para>In his defense would come the reply,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Leder kaasje heeft zijn gaatje!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>to caution that "every cheese has its hole" so nobody's
    perfect.</para>

    <para>The dismayed would retort,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Als de herder verdwaalt dolen the
    schapen.</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"If the shepherd gets lost the sheep just wander around." In other
    words, if the leader goes off in a wrong direction then other people don't
    quite know what to do.</para>

    <para>Or,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Nu breekt mijn klomp!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"Now my clog is breaking!" I am totally amazed and I certainly
    didn't expect that!.</para>

    <para>More colourfully,</para>

    <para><emphasis>"In de nesten zitten of werken!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He is sitting on a nest!" A country expression referring to the
    important task that millers have in keeping the area where the top rollers
    are free of birds nests. If birds get in there and build their nests then
    the rollers to turn the cap of the windmill jam resulting in a complete
    mess. So, the more thoughtful gossips have realized that Marcellus finds
    himself confused and not quite knowing what to do.</para>

    <para>The less kindly, or more jealous, counter that,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>op grote voet leven!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>He is wealthy, or "living on a big foot", so can afford to spend a
    lot of money on whatever he wants,including a new house.</para>

    <para>Those who envy his social position chip in with,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij laat de wereld op zijn duim
    draaien!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He lets the world spin on his thumb", implying that he has too much
    power!</para>

    <para>Countered by,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Je wordt geleefd!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He is being lived by life" rather than living life and is so busy
    that his life is out of control.</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij heeft het zo druk als de kippen voor
    Pasen!</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He is as busy as the chickens before Easter!"</para>

    <para>One thing all agree on is that,</para>

    <para>"<emphasis>Hij staat vast in zijn schoenen.</emphasis>"</para>

    <para>"He stands firmly in his shoes" so he knows his own mind and stands
    his ground.</para>

    <para>Inevitably the village chatter reached Paulina, who came to
    appreciate that the general view was that her father has upset people by
    not doing what they expected him to do. Whilst some shared her own thought
    that his recent personal losses and his hectic work schedule had clouded
    his judgement, all acknowledged that it had to be accepted that a man as
    wealthy, powerful and sure of himself as her father was not likely to
    question his chosen course of action or examine the reasons for it. Nor,
    she would add, is he likely to consider the impact on his daughter of
    seeing her childhood home razed to the ground.</para>

    <para>So,once she had grasped it, the opportunity that the Droost sisters
    provided of being able to unburden herself to good and trusted friends
    afforded Paulina some much needed relief from her private distress. But
    then she heard something which cast a new light on the situation and upset
    her once again. Helena and Cornelia, feeling that they may also speak
    freely to their friend, offered an additional insight concerning
    Marcellus's motivation behind the new house. By overhearing the talk
    around the building site, they had come to the view that Marcellus hopes
    to lure Paulina back to live with him permanently by building her a house
    in the style to which he fancies she has become accustomed in Den Haag. In
    addition, it seems that he hopes that such a grand property, coupled with
    the rise in status through association with himself, might overcome any
    reluctance on Johan's part to settle in Haastrecht. His strategy seems
    aimed at removing any conflict his daughter might feel between her duties
    to her husband and to her father by locating both men in the same
    place.</para>

    <para>Paulina was astounded by this perspective on matters. Her father had
    been astute only in so far as he recognised how torn she was between her
    life in Den Haag and her ties to her former home, however much she had
    hoped to conceal this from him. Since her mother's death she has felt the
    burden of management of the family's fall entirely onto her shoulders
    whether she wanted this or not. It would not be easy to find someone else
    to assist her father in matters which were second nature to her after a
    lifetime of involvement in the Bisdom van Vliet estate. There would be a
    lot for an incomer to get to grips with, not to mention the time it would
    take her to initiate them into the ways things should be done. Then there
    was the question of security and being able to trust an outsider with
    matters of business and politics which they would not wish broadcast.
    Perhaps her father had everyone's best interests at heart after all, but
    did it have to involve so much destruction!</para>

    <para>Paulina was distracted from her bewilderment and distress by a
    sudden outburst of excitement from Cornelia who had been punctuating their
    discussion with trips to peek around the lace curtain at the big bay
    window to their first floor salon from which vantage point she could look
    down into the street.</para>

    <para>"Oh, Paulina! Have you met Heer Hooft yet That's him outside now!
    Isn't he handsome! Oh, Paulina, do let's go down so that you can introduce
    us all. If you make as if to leave our house it would seem quite
    natural!"</para>

    <para>Clearly Cornelia had been smitten by the builder! Feeling that no
    good could come of encouraging her friend in yearning after a married man
    of unknown provenance and unsuitable social standing, Paulina made the
    quite legitimate excuse of not feeling up to such a demanding social
    encounter and wishing remain quietly where she was for a while longer.
    Besides, the three women still had many snippets of news to share and mull
    over.</para>

    <para/>

    <title/>

    <para>At last the clamour outside seemed to have died down to a tolerable
    level as the working day came to an end. Paulina rose and bade her
    grateful farewells to the Droost sisters before availing herself of the
    opportunity to venture outside again in relative calm. She was to join her
    father for dinner with their Pastor who had insisted that the temporarily
    homeless Marcellus lodge in the first floor corner room of his
    Kerkstraat<emphasis> pastorie</emphasis>. The two men were lifelong
    friends and very easy in each other's company so Paulina was looking
    forward to a relaxed visit and, since the weather was fine, enjoying the
    short stroll on the way there.</para>

    <para>Her mind on the pleasures to come, Paulina failed to notice the man
    about to cross her path so was brought back to the present with a jolt
    when Heer Hooft slowed to a halt in order to avoid a collision. He raised
    his hat to her with the clear intention of doing more than just politely
    greeting her before resuming his journey. Indeed, he made plain that he
    knew who she was and begged her indulgence as he introduced himself. It
    seems that he had noticed her visit to the building site earlier on and
    how distressed she had been by what she had found taking place there. He
    graciously expressed his concern for her and enquired as to how she now
    fared. She sensed his empathy with her feelings at seeing her family home
    and all its memories and associations reduced to a pile of ugly and
    useless rubble.</para>

    <para>Now having the opportunity to take him in, Paulina found that he
    was, indeed, a handsome man who was surprisingly young-looking to hold
    such a responsible position. He told her that he had just moved his
    household to Haastrecht from Den Haag so as to be more closely involved
    with her father's project. Paulina enquired after his family and
    discovered that he had a son, Hendrik Willem, who was approaching his
    fourth birthday and that his wife was expecting their second child in a
    month or so. Paulina remarked that she had moved in the opposite
    direction, leaving Haastrecht for Den Haag upon her marriage a few years
    earlier. She found him easy company and that their encounter was not the
    socially strained affair that their difference in standing had led her to
    anticipate. So, their first conversation came to a well-orchestrated and
    amicable closure with both going their separate ways having made positive
    comments on the almost certainty of their meeting again. As they parted,
    she caught out of the corner of her eye the twitch of a lace curtain at
    the Droost first floor window!</para>

    <para>From another first floor window, her father had been watching for
    her arrival so was waiting on the steps of the pastor's house before
    Paulina had reached the door. He greeted her enthusiastically before
    sweeping her inside to be taken under the wing of the pastor in his salon
    where his wife was waiting to serve refreshments to the small party.
    Marcellus was keen to hear Paulina's impression of the work on his new
    house but Paulina didn't have the heart to tell him how awful she had
    found the whole thing. Her father was more animated than she had seen him
    for a long time and looked in good health. Clearly the new venture had
    given him a fillip, whatever she might be feeling about it.</para>

    <para>As her visit progressed, Paulina came to understand that her
    father's rejuvenation was at least partly the result of the good food and
    congenial company he was enjoying at the pastor's house. The temporary
    hiatus in his own domestic affairs, since there now was no household, had
    also lifted some of the burden he usually carried. Paulina felt a rush of
    guilt as she realised that her father had been starting to fade away and
    it would not have been long before his health began to suffer. On top of
    the revelation that the new house was, in no small part, designed to lure
    her back to Haastrecht, she suddenly saw how much her father needed her.
    By contrast, she had to admit to herself, however, painfully, that Johan
    only came alive when he was away from home. Indeed, he seemed to shrink
    into himself when confined to the routine behaviours expected of a man of
    his social standing. She had much to think about on her carriage journey
    back home.</para>

    <para>Paulina was next in Haastrecht when her presence was requested at a
    meeting between her father and Theodorus Hooft. By this time the roof of
    the old house about to be removed. The tiles would be sorted and neatly
    stacked ready for re-use on other buildings in the area, discarding any
    that were too fragile or already broken. The money from the sale of the
    old tiles would go at least a little way towards offsetting the cost of
    the new roofing materials. By the same token, the wood from the supporting
    timbers would be kept for building purposes if it was sound, or cut for
    firewood if it was rotten, wormy or damaged in removal.</para>

    <para>Theodorus had a gentle soul in spite of the tough exterior required
    to do his job. This was why he had wanted his clients to see the old house
    whilst it still resembled a habitable dwelling, conscious of the
    associations it would have accrued through a lifetime of memories. He
    understood the form of grief that was in store for them. Once the roof had
    been taken away, the next stage in demolition would be removal of the
    ceilings, at which point the interior would be open to the elements. The
    rooms where the routines of daily life and the outstanding significant
    events of their times had taken place would be crudely exposed to public
    view. Prying eyes would make gossip over the rain sodden wood, plaster,
    paper and fitments that once graced the public and private chambers of the
    Burgermeester's family. For the two remaining members of that family, the
    shell of their home would be shorn of all their human activity. The old
    house would be dead and lost to them forever. Just simple lumps of
    material on a building site, as it already was for him.</para>

    <para>"I respectfully requested that you join me here today because I have
    had an idea which I wanted to put to. I realise that this destructive
    phase of the new house project is very hard for you both. So, I have been
    entertaining a notion which might make the wrench with the past a little
    easier. Perhaps if we could carry forward something of the old house to
    incorporate into the new one then you would be comforted by a sense of
    continuity."</para>

    <para>He paused in order to gauge how his idea was being received.
    Encouraged by their apparent openness to his proposal, Theodorus
    continued,</para>

    <para>"I wondered if there might be some discrete, structural part of the
    interior which hold special meaning for you and which would be suitable
    for relocation. If you can bear it, take a look around inside whilst it is
    still safe to do so. You might bid farewell to each room whilst having in
    mind the selection one fixture, such as door and frame or fireplace, in
    the old house which you would like me to transplant into your new home.
    Take care to choose something you both like and gives you pleasant
    feelings just to look at it. But also bear in mind that I need to be able
    to ensure that it can be removed intact and that we can find a place for
    it in the new design where it will look natural. If you approve, I will
    leave you to look around by yourselves but will be on hand should you need
    me and when you are ready to discuss your choice."</para>

    <para>With that, Theodorus bowed politely then withdrew to continue his
    supervision of his workmen. Out of the corner of his eye he saw his
    clients regard each other for a long moment then exchange a few words
    before the Burgermeester gave a quick, decisive nod and they turned
    towards the open door and slowly made their way inside the house that was
    no longer their home.</para>

    <para>He has expected it to take them a considerable length of time to
    tour the property and reach a decision so was taken by surprise when,
    barely fifteen minutes later, he noticed one of his men hurrying in his
    direction with a message from the Burgemeester requesting his attendance.
    He located his client and Mevrouwe le Fevre de Montigny by almost bowling
    them over as he entered the lage huis voorkamer. Both were calmly
    contemplating a large section of wooden screening which incorporated two
    doorways and a number of etched glass panels. It was rather larger than
    Theodorus had foreseen but he could see the attraction as it was both
    decorative and functional with the benefit that it met his needs as a
    builder. It was an easy assumption that the screen held some significance
    for his clients since they had agreed upon it so rapidly. So, before
    matters went any further he needed to make a detailed inspection to make
    sure that this quite delicate installation could be removed without peril
    and that it was sound in itself. The last thing any of them would want
    would be to introduce a pest, such as woodworm, into a brand new building.
    However, on the face of it, they had made an excellent choice. So much so
    that he wondered why he hadn't spotted its potential himself!</para>

    <para>Bidding farewell to his clients with the promise of letting them
    know his verdict next day, Theodorus set about his inspection but not
    before he had instructed his men to make haste to remove the roof since
    the upper floors were not involved in the preservation of the screen.
    Although his initial impression of the soundness of the piece was
    favourable, he had a secondary motivation in taking time to reach a final
    decision. He wanted to test out the local man appointed as his second in
    command.,Cornelis Straver. Cornelis came from a long line of timmermen,
    carpenters, by trade from a well respected village family and was assumed
    to have some expertise to bring to the matter at hand. However, he was
    only nineteen years old and had never been involved in a big project
    before. Theodorus wanted to take the opportunity to test Cornelis out and,
    all being well, begin to forge good working elations with him.</para>

    <para/>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>Cornelis was employed on the carving of a sturdy, oak door for one
    of the high street houses when the messenger from Heer Hooft reached him.
    He wasn't due to begin work on the Bisdom van Vliet new house until
    construction started and wondered why he had been called upon now. His
    father looked up from his work and, with a slight smile, nodded that it
    was alright for Cornelis to leave the job he was doing, saying,</para>

    <para>"Go! But best clean yourself up a bit first!"</para>

    <para>All the family knew that it was important that Cornelis make a good
    first impression on Heer Hooft. He put away his tools in their proper
    places in the workshop, as was the disciplined habit of his trade, then
    crossed the yard and went into the family's cottage. In the kitchen he
    took one of the buckets of water his mother had lined up after she had
    filled them at the river that morning. He filled a basin at the sink,
    removed his shirt and splashed himself in the cold water down to his
    waist, drying himself off on the discarded shirt. His mother had fetched
    him a clean shirt and a comb for his hair.</para>

    <para>Aware that it would have been easy for the young carpenter to be
    overawed by a man old enough to be his father as well as well versed in
    the construction of Haagse style houses, his mother sought to calm his
    nerves before this sudden and unexpected meeting. As she fussed round him
    she reminded him that,</para>

    <para>"Your father never had much regard for plasterers, it being an
    inferior trade to ours. And you know what they say about Haagenars? All
    show and no substance."</para>

    <para>"Oh, mother! I'll be alright! After all, he's just a man like any
    other!"</para>

    <para>With that, he headed back outside, collected his satchel of basic
    tools from its peg in the workshop, slung it across his body and set off
    to see what Heer Hooft wanted. Arriving at the site, he was directed into
    the Lage Huis where he found Heer Hooft examining a painted and glazed
    screen. Cornelis removed his hat, stuffing it in his bag, before taking
    the hand stretched out towards him. After exchanging pleasantries,
    Cornelis remembering to congratulate his senior on the recent birth of his
    daughter and been assured that mother and baby were thriving, they got
    down to the matter at hand.</para>

    <para>Cornelis understood that his carpenter's knowledge to be applied to
    forming a judgement as to the viability of removing the screen intact with
    a view to using it in the new house. Both men applied themselves to a
    close scrutiny of the state of the wood, Cornelis begging leave to scratch
    away the paint in places in order to be assured of the integrity of the
    raw wood concealed beneath. Having concluded their survey, both agreed
    that there were no signs of infestation on rot which would preclude the
    introduction of the screen into a new construction.</para>

    <para>Next, Cornelis investigated the means by which the screen had been
    inserted into its current position. After a while, he turned to Heer Hooft
    with a question in mind,</para>

    <para>"Do I understand correctly that this building is to be otherwise
    demolished?"</para>

    <para>Receiving an answer in the affirmative, he continued,</para>

    <para>"This screen is an original dating back to the time of King Louis XV
    of France and was put in place when the Lage Huis was built by Theodorus
    Bisdom in the middle of the 18th Century. This means that the screen is a
    classical piece and the it is important to preserve it if at all possible
    In addition, as you probably know, Burgermeester Theodorus Bisdom used his
    wealth to expand the family home and acquire the Slot van Vliet and
    surrounding lands. It was his investment that gave the Bisdom van Vliet's
    their full name as well as establishing them as important patriarchs. So,
    screen is a reminder of the rise of the family so not only an good choice
    for what it is in itself but also what it means to the current family
    members."</para>

    <para>Heer Hooft expressed his surprise at the significance of what he
    heard and complimented Cornelis on his knowledgeableness. Cornelis
    returned to the thrust of his original question,</para>

    <para>" The only way such a delicate and old piece can be safely removed
    is by careful removal of its surrounding structures. In other words, it
    will need painstaking excavation rather than the usual level of care
    applied to demolition work."</para>

    <para>Heer Hooft acknowledged what he was being told and that it would
    mean slow, painstaking and, of course, expensive work the cost of which
    would need to be put to Burgemeester Bisdom van Vliet in balance to the
    significance of the screen. Cornelis had proved his worth and impressed
    his senior with his confidence and maturity during their first working
    encounter. This encouraged Heer Hooft to further include Cornelis in the
    next phase of the screen project, namely where, and how, in the design of
    the new house the screen could be put to use. In order to further this
    discussion, he conducted Cornelis to his makeshift office where the plans
    for the new house were unrolled onto a large, plain wood table, the
    corners weighted down with fragments of complex plasterwork.</para>

    <para>Both men poured over the ground floor plan, each suggesting
    possibilities but rejecting them all. Cornelis was concerned that there
    should be no structural load on the delicate, if not quite fragile, screen
    and Heer Hooft raising matters of the utility of the public rooms,
    possible privacy issues and the undeniable fact that they just did not fit
    with the modern architectural style. Cornelis found it increasingly easy
    to voice his thoughts as they occurred to him and that he could accept the
    older man's sometimes opposing views without feeling diminished. In short,
    the two men seemed to have got off on a sound footing.</para>

    <para>Turning to the plan of the upper floor, there developed an
    optimistic atmosphere. The architect had divided the floor into two,
    separate appartments: one for Burgermeester Bisdom van Vliet and another
    for his daughter and her husband. So, whilst the public rooms were shared,
    there were private quarters upstairs for the two generations of Bisdom van
    Vliet. Since each apartment had a separate entrance from the spacious area
    at the top of the main staircase, they came to the resolution of dividing
    the screen so that part formed the entrance to one apartment and the rest
    the entrance to the other.</para>

    <para>Now Cornelis needed to look at how the screen might be divided
    whilst Heer Hooft persuaded the architect to alter his plans. The latter
    proved easier than anticipated since the architect had harboured some
    uneasiness about the upper hall, worried that it was too dark. The only
    natural light in his plans came from a window at the head of the stairs
    which, although the same large expanse of glass as all the other windows,
    was really not enough to penetrate the centrally located space of the
    upper hall. The glazed and white painted panels he was being asked to
    incorporate into his design suddenly prompted a radical change of
    perspective. The theme of light paint and maximum glazing could be the
    answer to lighting up the whole area!</para>

  <title>Summer 1876</title>

  <section>
    <title/>
    <para>Theodorus and Cornelis were going at each other hammer and tongues,
    oblivious to the audience they were attracting. The new batch of workmen
    who had been taken on in an effort to speed things up were looking on with
    some anxiety, somehow intuiting that they were the focus of the
    disagreement and hoping that it was not going to lead to their dismissal
    with the consequent return to poverty and idleness. The old hands,
    however, just shrugged and rolled their eyes, barely pausing in their
    work. The tension between the two bosses had been building for some time
    culminating in a storm that would blow itself out before the end of the
    day. No need to worry, they advised the new men, just get on with your
    tasks.</para>

    <para>It was, indeed, the arrival of the gang of new workers which had
    been the catalyst for the rather public venting of anger by the two
    overseers. They and their attendant problems were not the direct cause but
    consequent upon the approaching deadline for completion of the house which
    had been imposed by the <emphasis>burgermeester</emphasis>. Marcellus
    Bisdom van Vliet had his heart, and his <emphasis>gilders</emphasis>, set
    on being able to celebrate his 50 year anniversary as
    <emphasis>Burgermeester</emphasis> of Haastrecht from the new house which
    had been commissioned specially for this occasion. The whole village had
    involved themselves in grand plans to honour him, suddenly making concrete
    the date by which the house should be finished.</para>

    <para>August 23rd - and there was such a lot left to do!</para>

    <para>Much had been accomplished so far. Once the old house had been
    raised to its foundations, these had needed strengthening with new
    brickwork onto which the heavy timbers for the floor joists had been laid.
    Once the shell of the house had been built using thousands upon thousands
    of bricks it was time for the hard work of lifting and fitting the roof
    beams and trusses. The complex structure and area of the upper floor of
    the house made for a cats cradle of necessary wooden supporting structure
    which would be strong enough to take the Fries flat pan tiles of the roof.
    Meanwhile windows and doors were created and installed so that the
    building was weather proof and the interior work could begin.</para>

    <para>All of the heavy construction materials had to be brought along the
    river by barge. The craft were sized to fit the confines of the waterways
    they operated on and were each crewed by a single family who lived on
    board. To maximize cargo space the living quarters were squeezed into the
    stern with cooking, eating, washing and sleeping all vying for space.
    Boards laid across the space served as beds and had to be taken away
    before the day's domestic activities could begin. Families with many
    children crowded together so disease was rife, as was malnutrition as
    parents struggled to fill mouths on their meagre income. Yet more babies
    easily came along but many died before they were old enough to walk. It
    had not been unusual to see the wife harnessed to a line ashore pulling
    the laden barge whilst her husband, worn out by the effort of lading and
    unloading cargo, stayed on board and steered from the tiller at the stern.
    Wind and current were not always favourable to these folk and horse power
    often beyond their means. These were weatherbeaten and hard-muscled folk,
    old before their time with lives often prematurely ended by illnesses
    which the doctors were too busy to diagnose or treat, scrawling the word
    "exhaustion" when registering their death.</para>

    <para>At least the carters who then brought the finer timber for interior
    work and all the necessaries for plasterwork and decorative finishes could
    go home to a roof over their heads, however mean a hovel they called home.
    They worked their horses hard but Paulina, who had a strong interest in
    matter equine, made sure that the animals were not ill treated or
    underfed. Some said that she showed more care for the welfare of the
    horses than their handlers.</para>

    <para>Since Theodorus could not manage the building work and do the
    plasterwork himself, he had engaged FPC Schild to undertake the massive
    amount of skilled work in plastering the ceilings and all the decorative
    plasterwork of the interior. Herein lay the source of the argument between
    Theodorus and Cornelis. The plasterwork was falling behind schedule
    because other work, which needed to be done first, had not been completed.
    Hence the influx of new workers. However, both Theodorus and Cornelis had
    laid claim to these men and set them on competing tasks. Given the tense
    atmosphere created by time pressure, it was perhaps understandable that
    the conflict erupted into an angry exchange. Once some steam had been let
    off, both men were able to regain their usual level headedness and their
    usually excellent working relationship was able to reassert itself so that
    the next time men looked in their direction they saw the tow men briefly
    embracing each other then shaking hands with smiles on their faces.</para>

    <title/>

    <para>Theodrus and Cornelis shut themselves up in the makeshift office and
    let it be known that they were only to be disturbed in case of dire
    emergency. Any knocks on the door or timid calls were ignored. Their
    agreed strategy was to take an imaginary walk through the house, compiling
    lists of unfinished work in each room as they went. They also had a draft
    of the plans for the day of Marcellus's 50th anniversaryas burgermeester
    celebrations.</para>

    <para>The obvious place to start was with the ingang/entrance and
    vestibule which it led into. Placed in the centre of the the six bays on
    the ground floor, the large, sturdy wooden door was already in place.
    Although it opened as a single door, a central column decorated with vines
    and grapes gave the impression of double doors. Symmetrical panels were
    glazed and decorated with wrought ironwork. Above and below each inset
    glass were carved panels, oblong below and circular bosses topped with
    semi-circular arches above. The rich colour of the wood and the
    multi-faceted carving were pleasing to the eye and the whole was sturdy
    and clearly designed to offer protection to the valuable contents which
    would eventually be contained within. Cornelis was proud of it and
    Theodorus thought this was rightly so.</para>

    <para>But, they couldn't linger in admiration as there was a long way to
    go and both agreed that the impressive entry needed no improvement. Once
    inside the door. An entrance hall led up to the doorway into the inner
    hall or gang at the end with a door leading off either side to a small
    salon on the left and a reception area on the right. In order to create
    symmetry, two false doors, one either side, had been created with a
    central bay of plasterwork between them. Since this was the first
    impression visitors, not to mention Marcellus, would have it needed to
    show how important and wealthy the occupants of the house were. The
    decoration of the vestibule was, therefore, designed to provide an opulent
    impression but only as a backdrop for the displays of valuable items and
    family crests destined to be placed there. So, whilst the ceiling rose,
    cornicing and the headers above the doors involved complex plaster
    mouldings which had been delicately painted in muted creams, the central
    panels were relatively plain with a touch of blue in places to set off the
    blue of the Chinese plates destined to be hung nearby. A marble floor
    provided the finishing touch to this relatively small but hugely important
    space. </para>

    <para>The first room off the vestibule was the speekkamer or reception
    room. This would be where the maid who answered the door would take
    visitors to wait whilst she conveyed messages to and fro the occupants of
    the house. Tradespeople would wait here to be paid and more important
    callers to be admitted to the grote salon through the far door. A
    relatively plain room, then. Even so, it was yet to be finished as the
    expensive red flock wallpaper from England, chosen as a foil for the gilt
    framed paintings destined to be displayed against it, remained to be hung.
    Again, concerns about keeping the decoration clean came to the surface as
    flock wallpaper was notorious for attracting dirt. Since the guests
    admitted to the house for Marcellus's celebration were by invitation only,
    it was agreed that the completion of this room could be assigned a low
    priority.</para>

    <para>The same could not be said of the kleine salon through the second
    door off the vestibule. This was where Marcellus planned greet his guests
    and provide refreshments. </para>

    <para>Again, all the work had been done but the challenge was to keep it
    in pristine condition despite the mess being created by work in progress
    in the rest of the house. Use of the front door had been banned with
    everything and everyone coming in through the kitchen and garden room
    entrances. The doorway at the end of the vestibule marked the transition
    from the public to the private areas of the house and, to mark the
    importance of this, had been built to double thickness to accommodate two
    doors,one after the other. To create a further barrier, provision had been
    made for a heavy curtain to span the width of the wall at the end of the
    vestibule. A temporary curtain had been hung here then both doors closed
    with the door on the family side sealed.</para>
